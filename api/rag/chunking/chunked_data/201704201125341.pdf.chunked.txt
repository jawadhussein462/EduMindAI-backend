The use of non-programmable calculators is allowed. Exercise 1 (7 points) Effect of the frequency on the current The circuit, represented in the adjacent document (Doc 1), includes in series: G - A generator (G) delivering, across its terminals, an alternating voltage, UAF = UG = 8sin(2ft) (S.I.); - A capacitor of capacitance C = 0.265 uF; - A coil of inductance L = 31.833 mH and of negligible resistance; - A resistor of resistance R = 100 Q. D H F ŁA R L C The circuit carries then an alternating current i of expression: Y1 (Doc 1) Y2 i = Im sin (2xft + q) (S.I.). The aim of this exercise is to study the effect of the frequency f of uG on the amplitude Im of i and on the phase difference o between i and uG. An oscilloscope, connected as shown in the document (Doc.1), is used to display the voltages uG and UR = UDF. The vertical sensitivity, of both channels, is the same in all the experiments: Sv = 2 V/div. 1) 1rst experiment We set the frequency at f = f1 = 1500 Hz. We observe on the screen of the oscilloscope the waveforms displayed in the adjacent document (Doc.2). (a) 1-1) Identify the waveforms (a) and (b). (b) 1-2) Determine the phase difference q1 between i and uG. 1-3) Calculate the amplitude Ilm of the current i. 2) 2nd experiment. The frequency f is increased to f = fo, fo being the proper frequency of the (RLC) series circuit. We notice that the waveforms obtained coincide. The circuit is thus the seat of a certain phenomenon. 2-1) Give the name of the physical phenomenon obtained. (Doc 2) 2-2) Give the value of the new phase difference Q2 between i and uG. 2-3) Deduce the value of fo and the new amplitude I2m of i. 3) 3rd experiment 3-1) We measure Im and o for three other values of f; the results are tabulated as shown in the adjacent table (Doc 3). Complete this table. 3-2) Referring to the table (Doc 3), draw the graph representing the variation of Im as a function of f. f (Hz) 1000 1500 fo =? 2220 2500 Im (A) 0.02 0.04 0.03 ₱ (rd) 1.33 -1.04 -1.2 (Doc 3) 3-3) Conclude about the effect of f on the amplitude Im of i and on the sign of the phase difference q between i and uG. 1/3

Exercise 2 (7 points) Energies and collision A particle (S1), of mass m1 = 200 g, is released from rest at the point A on a track ABOE, found in a vertical plane, as shown in the adjacent document (Doc 4). (Sı) The part AB, very smooth, along which we can neglect the force of friction, has the shape of a circular arc of radius ha, and the part BO, a rough part, along which X the force of friction f is supposed constant, is a rectilinear and horizontal path with BO = 1 m. ha! (Doc 4) (S2) 1000000-E B E X 1 The particle (S1) reaches the point B with the speed VIB = 4 m/s, then it covers the track BO to reach the point O with the speed vio = 2 m/s. At O, (S1) enters into a head-on collision with a particle (S2), of mass m2 = 400 g, initially at rest and connected to the end of a horizontal spring of stiffness k = 100 N/m whose other end is fixed at E. Take the horizontal plane containing BO as a gravitational potential energy reference level. Take g = 10 m/s2. 1) Conservation and non-conservation of the mechanical energy. 1-1) Applying the principle of conservation of the mechanical energy of the system [(S1), Earth], determine hA. 1-2) Determine the work done by the force of friction f along BO. 1-3) Deduce the magnitude f of the force of friction f along BO. 2) Elastic collision. The collision between the particles (S1) and (S2) is perfectly elastic. All the velocities, before and after the collision, are along the horizontal axis x'Ox. 2-1) Determine the speed v'10 of (S1) and v'20 of (S2) just after the collision. 2-2) Neglecting the force of friction between (S2) and the track, just after the collision, calculate the maximum compression Xm = OD of the spring. 2-3) In fact, the force of friction f' between (S2) and the track, just after the collision, is not negligible and the maximum compression of the spring is x'm = OD' = 6.4 cm. 2-3-1) Determine the decrease in the mechanical energy of the system [(S2), Earth, spring], between O and D'. 2-3-2) In what form of energy does this decrease appear? Exercise 3 (6 points) Radioactivity of Thallium The radioactive isotope of Thallium 297Tl is a ßemitter, of radioactive period 135 days. The disintegration of a Thallium 207 nucleus produces a daughter nucleus, the lead nucleus 2Pb.The kinetic energy of the emitted ß" particle is KE (B) = 0.70 MeV. This disintegration is accompanied by the emission of a gamma radiation (Y) of energy E(y), and an antineutrinogv of energy E ((v) = 0.10 MeV. The equation of disintegration is given by: 81T -> 2Pb + je + (v + Y Given: m (4Pb) = 206.9759 u; m (2077 81Tl) = 206.9775 u; 1 eV = 1.6×10-19 J; m (_[e) = 5.486×10-4 u; NA=6.023×1023. 1 u = 931.5 MeV/c2; 2/3
