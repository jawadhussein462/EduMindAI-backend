| The | first | optional | set: | Analysis | of | social | documents. | (12 | pts.) | Document | 1: | According | to | two | national | reports | on | poverty | and | living | conditions | revealed | by | the | Ministry | of | Social | Affairs | and | the | United | Nations | Development | Program | (UNDP), | 28% | of | Lebanon's | population | are | considered | poor | and | 8% | live | in | conditions | of | extreme | poverty. | Of | concern, | some | 300,000 | Lebanese | are | unable | to | meet | their | basic | nutritional | and | non-food | needs. | The | geographical | distribution | of | poverty | is | also | a | matter | of | concern, | and | significant | differences | have | been | identified | between | the | central | and | peripheral | regions | of | the | country. | Poverty | rates | are | relatively | low | in | the | capital, | in | Beirut | less | than | 6 | %, | while | the | north | accounts | for | 53% | of | overall | poverty, | 29% | in | the | Bekaa, | 28% | in | the | south, | and | 20% | in | Nabatieh | and | Mount | Lebanon. | According | to | the | study, | poverty | affects | some | professions | more | than | others | can | affect. | The | poor | are | concentrated | among | unemployed | workers | and | workers | in | sectors | such | as | agriculture | and | construction. | The | results | indicate | that | young | people | with | university | degrees | are | also | struggling | to | break | the | cycle | of | poverty, | and | the | unemployment | rate | for | non-poor | college | graduates | is | half | the | rate | for | university | graduates | who | are | very | poor. | 'We | hope | reports | will | be | a | valuable | tool | for | policymakers | to | improve | targeting,' | more | concrete | planning, | as | well | as | the | development | of | programs | and | initiatives', | said | Ruedas. | http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/lebanon-News/2009/Feb-05/52975-some-28-percent-of-lebanese-live-below-poverty-line-study.ashx | :_ | Document | 2: | According | to | a | field | study | of | the | UNESCO | Beirut | office | on | 'Transition | from | school | to | work | for | young | women | in | Lebanon', | limited | access | to | decent | work | is | one | of | the | main | reasons | for | the | marginalization | of | young | people | in | Arab | countries. | Young | women | tend | to | be | more | disadvantaged | in | terms | of | access | to | employment, | career | development | and | professional | diversity. | The | results | clearly | identified | a | number | of | obstacles | faced | by | these | young | graduates. | These | obstacles | reflect, | on | the | one | hand, | family | restrictions | on | their | choice | of | competencies | and | type | of | work, | the | personal | limitations | of | the | selected | competencies, | and | the | academic | and | professional | competencies | they | have | acquired | that | are | not | commensurate | with | the | requirements | of | the | labor | market. | Some | female | graduates | are | also | reluctant | to | have | the | necessary | skills | required | by | the | labor | market, | and | not | to | have | the | opportunity | to | gain | practical | experience | at | the | university. | For | those | who | work, | they | are | dissatisfied | with | the | self-employment | and | career | development | offered | by | their | jobs. | On | the | other | hand, | young | graduates | seem | to | complain | about | the | lack | or | inadequacy | of | vocational | guidance | and | guidance | services, | and | the | absence | of | formal | channels | of | employment | or | objective | employment | practices, | as | they | depend | heavily | on | social | and | personal | relationships | and |
