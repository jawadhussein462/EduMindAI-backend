The Power of Advertising Industry 1 Have you ever asked what advertising industry is about? Have you ever wondered why nowadays many companies from different industries try to constantly outdo one another? If you are not observant enough, try checking out all the advertising and branding strategies they use to their advantage just to gain at least a few significant steps ahead from their competitors. It's a constant battle on who gets to most patronage from consumers, which will equate to a bigger market share that would ultimately mean generating higher sales. 2 The advertising industry has witnessed a dramatic transformation in its processes and has highlighted some approaches and campaigns that have been most successful. The biggest change, of course, is the explosion of data now available to advertisers as they try to connect with consumers across a multitude of platforms such as internet, cellphones and TV to make more profits. 3 Also, advertising and marketing organizations have made major moves into using what is known as "analytics" technology that measures performance and evaluates success. For best companies, outcomes indicated they could achieve major boosts in marketing effectiveness and revenue. However, others still struggle with problems in integrating data-driven thinking across the company and bringing insights into decision-making actions. 4 The industry of advertising and branding is more complicated than an ordinary person would normally think. Many concepts are developed and deliberated; surveys are made to determine the markets' current preferences. This is all geared towards making intelligent calculations on the consumers' reactions to certain products and towards the most effective approach in introducing such products in the market. In advertising and branding, nothing can be attributed to a simple stroke of luck or an instant phenomenal success. Everything is a product of tough work. That is why advertising companies employ an elite team of highly talented people to conceptualize and ensure product success in the market. 5 So how can one correctly estimate the victory or failure of any advertising and branding effort? Well, it's quite simple. You can try showing a certain image, logo, color combination or a pattern to a number of consumers, and if they are able to properly identify the product behind it, you can say all marketing efforts have achieved a certain degree of success. 6 The first key role of advertising and branding is generating awareness and recognition of a certain product or service. The second most important thing is to actually condition the minds of consumers as to what image you would want them to associate with the product, whether it is cheap, durable, dependable, etc. This is the intrinsic value of advertising and branding and can be a little harder to determine. For example, if you mention toothpastes, what brand would first come to mind to consumers? Or if you ask for the most wonderful vacation hotspot, what would be the 1

first word they would likely blurt out? This does not necessarily mean they have actually been to that particular place; it's their perception of the place for what they have seen and heard that made them believe it's actually the top choice. This is how advertisers are in command of the consumers' choice. 7 On the other side of the coin, once advertisement establishes a very strong and powerful brand name, companies will find it hard to step away from its mighty shadows. If in the future the company would want to project a new image, or take on a different market position

If in the future the company would want to project a new image, or take on a different market position, it can be a difficult task to escape the identity that has been established. This would take another series of powerful marketing efforts to transform the image of the product. It's a whole new ball game and a very expensive one. This is the beauty of advertising and branding. It is certainly the most powerful marketing tool that can make or break a company.
