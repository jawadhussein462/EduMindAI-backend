(9 points) (7 points) 2- Discuss this judgment based on other concepts. 3- Do you think that repression of tendencies is a morally desirable attitude? Justify your answer. (4 points) · Subject Two : Mathematical elements are the fruit of reason; they owe nothing to the concrete world. 1- Explain this judgment and state the problematic it raises. (9 points) 2- Discuss this judgment in light of other theories. (7 points) 3- Do you believe - that mathematics is useful for social sciences? Justify your answer. (4 points) · Subject Three: Happiness which forms the utilitarian standard of what is right in conduct, is not the agent's own happiness, but that of all concerned. As between his own happiness and that of others, utilitarianism requires him to be as strictly impartial as a disinterested and benevolent spectator. In the golden rule of Jesus of Nazareth, we read the complete spirit of the ethics of utility. To do as you would be done by, and to love your neighbor as yourself, constitute the ideal perfection of utilitarian morality. As the means of making the nearest approach to this ideal, utility would enjoin: First, that laws and social arrangements should place the happiness, or (as speaking practically it may be called) the interest, of every individual, as nearly as possible in harmony with the interest of the whole. Secondly, that education and opinion, which have so vast a power over human character, should so use that power as to establish in the mind of every individual an indissoluble association between his own happiness and the good of the whole; especially between his own happiness and the practice of such modes of conduct, negative and positive, as regard for the universal happiness prescribes. J.S.Mill 1- Explain this text and state the problematic it raises. (9 points) 2- Discuss thetheory of the text in light of other theories. (7 points) 3- Do you believe - that morality can become universal? Justify your answer. (4 points) 1

المادة: فلسفة وحضارات الشهادة: الثانوية العامة الفرع: اجتماع واقتصاد / علوم حياة / علوم عامة نموذج رقم -4- المدّة : ساعتان الهيئة الأكاديميّة المشتركة قسم : الفلسفة المركز التربوي للحوثِ وَالإنهاء أسس التصحيح (تراعي تعليق الدروس والتوصيف المعدّل للعام الدراسي ٢٠١٦ -٢٠١٧ وحتى صدور المناهج المطوّرة) SubjectOne: First question: (9 points) Introduction (2 points) - "Tendency" is the vaguest concept of psychology; But it should not be confused with "desire" or "need" ... - While instinct is specific, tendency is individual. Hence the importance of the debate. Problematic (2 points) General (0.5 pt.): What is the nature of the Tendency? Specific (1.5 pt.): Can we say thatTendencies are of an empirical nature and that they emerge from a sensitive experience? Or are they manifested in the movement and behavior of man? Thesis (5 points) Preliminary idea (0.5 pt.): Indeed, this judgment belongs to the empiricist's current which considers that the origin of all human knowledge comes only from sensible experience, from observation. Thus our senses are at the source of our knowledge. Explanation of the judgment (4 pts): The sensualists, including Condillac, affirm that no tendency is innate. Everything begins with a first experience lived, accompanied by pleasure. The memory of this pleasure encourages us to relive this experience. Repetition sets in as a habit and creates the tendency. (It is the case of the tendencies of the young people: the exotic food, the mobile phone ... ) - Even if the first experiment was unpleasant (work, tobacco ... ) repetition would make a tendency. - This conception recognizes the role of the educator. Creativity and coherence (0.5 pt.) Second question: Discussion (7 points) Transition (0.5 pt.): However, it would be a mistake to reduce the nature of the tendency to pleasure and sensible experience. Internal review (1 pt.): The pleasure itself can be explained only by the predisposition, the tendency beforehand, if we do not all enjoy the same pleasure. -The tendency precedes the sensation or experience of pleasure. According to Spinoza "between tendency and desire there is no difference except that desire is the tendency with self-consciousness. " -The memory of previous meals and past experiences modify the tendency but do not create it. External review (3.5 pts): The tendency is a motor manifestation. According to Ribot, "the tendency is a movement or a cessation of movement in the nascent state". -Behavior (movements or repetitions) is the "cause" of affectivity (tendency). -Repetition of the smoking act creates in us the tendency. Synthesis (1.5 pt.): The two sensualist and behaviorist thesis have not been able to refute the classical thesis, which explains the tendency as a primary principle, as a force that guides behavior and feeling. 2

Nevertheless, these two theories have had the merit of highlighting the role of affective experience and habit or training in the revelation of the tendency and its fixation to its object. So the trends are indirectly observable, they are dominated by affectivity and are experienced and felt in behavior. Creativity and coherence (0.5 pts) Third question: (4 points) Explanation of the question (1 pt.) Justification (2.5 pts): - The candidate could answer this question affirmatively or negatively or dialectically, provided that he/she justifies his/her answer. - The candidate will judge freely: -Either he asserts that trends must be controlled by willpower and moral values: a trend that would not be hoisted to a human level is not acceptable. -Either he recalls that the repressed tendencies "take revenge": neurosis, psychosomatic diseases ... and that the trends must be respected: we owe them artistic works, scientific achievements ... Creativity and coherence (0.5 pts) Subject Two: First question: (9 points) Introduction (2 points) -You can launch the debate by emphasizing the difference between experimental and abstract sciences -We can also remember that mathematics is one of the first disciplines that human civilizations had known. -Note that mathematics is of many aspects: algebra, geometry, trigonometry, probability calculation ... Problematic (2 points) General (0.5 pt.): What is the origin of mathematics? Specific (1.5 pts.): Is it originated by the sense in contact with the outside world? Or by reason? Is it from an abstract origin such as intelligence? Thesis (5 points) Preliminary idea (0.5 pt.): This is the idealistic point of view-the rationalist point of view is to be explained: the senses cannot provide "materials" needed to develop abstract symbols: I 00 or ... Explanation of the judgment (4 pts.): The abstract intelligence is detached from the concrete to create symbols. -Plato: their origin is in the world of ideas .... -Malebranche: in the "divine mind", that's why their relationships are invariable .... -Kant, since the level of abstraction is inaccessible to children of low age ... -Descartes ... Creativity and coherence (0.5 pt.) Second question: Discussion (7 points) Transition (0.5 pt.): However, it would be a mistake to reduce the nature of mathematical notions to the simple work of reason. Internal review (1 pt.): Practical intelligence is above abstract intelligence (homo fiber came first .... ) -It was urgent to solve practical problems: sale, exchange, division ofland ... -Even the "abstract" mathematics: calculating probabilities was a need for gambling ... 3

External Review (3.5 pts.): We oppose with the empiricist theory that states that; all knowledge comes from the senses. (Mill, Poincaré ... -The contact of the senses with material objects is the cause of mathematical symbols: -The mountain inspired the triangle, the surface of the lake gives the idea of the plan ... -The evidence: -The first measurement units prove it: the span, thumb, arm length ... -And "calculation" that was the way to count the cattle ... Synthesis (1.5 pt.): These two theories, empiricist and idealistic, are based on incontestable facts, but draw conclusions too simple and too absolute, and see only one aspect of mathematical notions. -The opposition between empiricism and idealism must now be overcome in the framework of the mathematical theory of operation. -Mathematics represents a real conquest, but a gradual conquest resulting from a secular effort of the human mind. Creativity and coherence (0.5 pts) Third question: Personal opinion(4 points) Explanation of the question (1 pt.) Justification (2.5 pts): - The candidate could answer this question affirmatively or negatively or dialectically, provided that he/she justifies his/her answer. The answer may vary: -Yes: all current psychological objective uses mathematical processes (testing .... ) And statistics, sociology ... -No: the human experience cannot be measured: it is difficult to express in numbers. -Can we calculate the anger of the masses in rebellion? Creativity and coherence (0.5 pts) Subject three: Text First question: (9 points) Introduction (2 points) -The debate can be introduced by: -A reminder of the exclusively human character of morality. -The "case of conscience" that leaves us undecided before the need to find the value, to act ... -The importance of the debate: the thinkers are interested, certainly, but also every person concerned to judge his behavior, in values ... Problematic (2 points) General (0.5 pt.): How to define "the good"? Specific (1.5 pts.): What would be the value on which to base a moral system? According to what criterion can - we recognize the good and evil? Thesis (5 points) Preliminary idea (0.5 pt.): Indeed, this judgment adopts the point of view of utilitarianism, the latter is a philosophical current that bases all morality on the "useful" as the primary principle of action. He considers that what is useful is good and that "utility" can be determined rationally. Explanation of the judgment (4 pts.): To study the text should specify the meaning of: - "Happiness," in the utilitarian (no pain ... ) - "Interest" (definition of Epicurus: limitation of desires ... ) 4

- It should be noted that the emphasis in the text on "the detachment": it is morally desirable to get away from desires and interests. (There is a "spectator") — Man must focus on the "future", and conscious of its interests. - Moreover there is no conflict between "individual" and "the common good". This is the restriction of desires (by merely "natural and necessary" desires that leads to this conclusion. — Uses Christianity to prove this thesis. Creativity and coherence (0.5 pt.) Second question: Discussion (7 points) Transition (0.5 pt.): However, all the doctrines which identify the Good with an empirical element encounter a common difficulty which is that of bringing out a moral requirement of an element which starts only from the fact. Internal review (1 pt.): A criticism first: -We cannot accept this argument: -To live down on earth, without enthusiasm or ambition, would be limited to the strictly necessary, it is not worthy of man. -It is not clear that the interest of the individual is "in tune" with that of the community. External Review (3.5 pts.): Opposing arguments one could argue: -The Good, the duty (Durkheim ... ) -The Well, this is pleasure (A. Cyrene ... ) -Well, it is the interest (Bentham ... ) -The Good, the duty for duty (Kant ... ) Synthesis (1.5 pt.): It can be concluded that relativism is not the end of ethics. One cannot ignore the presence of important constants in the practice of ethics throughout history. Love, loyalty, and friendship have always been preferred to hatred, betrayal, and intimacy. -All this leads us to conclude that despite the important differences perceived in the practice of ethics over the years, we can say that there are some values that form a strong and essential sector in this immense diversity. Creativity and coherence (0.5 pts) Third question: Personal opinion(4 points) Explanation of the question (1 pt.) Justification (2.5 pts): - The candidate could answer this question affirmatively or negatively or dialectically, provided that he/she justifies his/her answer. - Yes, with the standardization that accompanies globalization, tastes, ideas, tendency approach. Will soon come a day when moral values are universal. - No: Morality always depend on the social, economic, cultural ... and will always be different from one medium to another.
