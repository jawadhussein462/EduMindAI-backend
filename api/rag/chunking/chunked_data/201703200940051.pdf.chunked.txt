| and | in | storms. | Even | in | clear | weather, | one | is | wise | to | stay | a | safe | distance | away | from | them. | Most | of | their | bulk | is | below | the | water | and | their | underwater | parts | may | extend | out | far | beyond | the | visible | top. | Yet, | they | may | roll | over | unexpectedly, | churning | the | water | around | them. | 6 | They | are | parts | of | glaciers | that | break | off, | drift | into | the | water, | float | about | for | a | while, | and | finally | melt. | Icebergs | that | float | today | were | originally | formed | in | a | slow | transformation | into | ice | from | snowflakes | that | have | fallen | over | long | periods | of | time | before | modern | history. | They | embody | snow | that | drifted | down | hundreds, | or | many | thousands, | or | in | some | cases | maybe | one | million | years | ago. | The | snow | fell | in | Polar | Regions | and | on | cold | mountains, | where | it | melted | only | a | little | or | not | at | all, | and | then | collected | to | great | depths | over | the | years | and | centuries. | 7 | As | each | year | snow | accumulated | on | the | surface, | evaporation | and | melting | caused | the | snowflakes | slowly | to | lose | their | feathery | points | and | become | tiny | grains | of | ice. | When | new | snow | fell | on | top | of | the | old, | it | too | turned | to | icy | grains. | So | blankets | of | snow | and | ice | grains | mounted | layer | upon | layer | and | were | of | such | great | thickness | that | the | weight | of | the | upper | layers | compressed | the | lower | ones. | With | time | and | pressure | from | above, | the | many | small | ice | grains | joined | and | changed | to | larger | crystals, | and | eventually | the | deeper | crystals | merged | into | a | solid | mass | of | ice. | 1 |
