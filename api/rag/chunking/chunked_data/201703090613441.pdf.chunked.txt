| 2.2.2 | The | correct | answer | is | (iii) | Concentrated | sulfuric | acid, | when | used | in | large | amounts, | acts | as | a | dehydrating | agent | that | eliminates | water | from | the | reaction | medium | and | thus | displaces | the | equilibrium | in | the | forward | direction | (Le | Chatelier); | this | increases | the | yield | of | the | esterification | reaction. | 1/4 | 1/2 | 3.1 | The | initial | number | of | moles | of | each | reactant: | n(Benzoic | acid) | = | m/M | = | 12.2/122 | = | 0.1 | mol | n(Methanol) | = | m/M | = | p | xV/M=800x4x103/32= | 0.1mol. | so | the | mixture | is | equimolar | since | n(Benzoic | acid) | = | n(Methanol)=0.1 | mol | 1 | 3.2 | Suppose | that | the | reaction | is | complete, | the | mixture | of | reactants | is | stoechiometric | (Racid | = | Rmethanol= | 0.1), | n(Ester)theoretical | = | 0,1 | mol | Then | m | (Ester)theoretical= | 0,1 | x136=13.6g | m(ester | ) | experimental | 8.1 | The | percent | yield | is | y | = | x100 | = | x100 | == | 60% | m(ester | )theoretical | 13.6 | (N.B: | the | yield | can | also | be | determined | using | the | number | of | moles). | 1/4 | 1/2 | 3.3 | - | Suggestion | 1 | : | True | The | yield | of | reaction | is | proportional | to | the | experimental | mass | of | ester. | When | part | of | the | experimental | mass | of | the | ester | is | lost, | the | percent | yield | decreases. | - | Suggestion | 2 | : | False | The | temperature | is | a | kinetic | factor | but | does | not | shift | equilibrium | since | it | is | an | athermic | reaction. | Therefore | it | increases | only | the | rate | of | reaction | of | both | directions | and | does | not | change | the | yield. | 1/4 | 1/2 | 1/4 | 1/2 | 4/4 |
