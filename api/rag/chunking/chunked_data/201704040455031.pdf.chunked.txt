Exercise 3 (7 points) The Mode of Action of Morphine Morphine, an analgesic used primarily to stop the sensation of pain, acts on specific receptors in the brain and in the spinal cord. Document 1 represents the set of neurons involved in the transmission of the pain message at the level of the spinal cord. Enkephalin Neuron 1 0 Synapse S2 Neuron S 1- Formulate two hypotheses concerning the mode of action of morphine. Neuron 2 Substance P Synapse Sı To determine the mode of action of morphine, many experiments are performed. The conditions and the Document 1 obtained results are presented in document 2, taking into Doc.1 is adopted from the 1st session of 2003 consideration that in each experiment the applied stimulation is effective, the amount of neurotransmitters released as well as the intensity of pain sensation are estimated by special techniques.

The presynaptic neuron of synapse S2 is the neuron B and the postsynaptic neuron is the neuron C. 1.5 2 Synapse S2 is excitatory since a response of 4 APs of the same amplitude are recorded by oscilloscope O connected to neuron C (postsynaptic neuron) when neuron B (presynaptic neuron) is stimulated. 1.5 3 The quantity of neurotransmitters released by neuron A is null whereas, a moderate quantity of neurotransmitters is released when only neuron B is effectively stimulated. This released quantity increases to be moderate for neuron A and high for neuron B, always greater than that of A after the simultaneous stimulation of neurons A and B; this shows that the action of neuron A facilitates the release of neurotransmitters by neuron B which is the presynaptic neuron of synapse S2. This corresponds to a phenomenon of facilitation where the action of a neuron increases the liberation of neurotransmitters by the terminal arborizations of sensory neurons. 2 4 The increase in the frequency of A.P in neuron C is due to the increase in the quantity of neurotransmitters released by neuron B from moderate to important. 1 Parts of Ex Exercise 2 (7 points) Mark 1.1 Volume of dioxygen= 60 Kg x 2.5 L.kg-1.h-1 x 2 h = 300 L 1 1.2 Energy expenditure = I.R x 20 Kj/L Energy expenditure = 300 Lx 20 Kj/L= 6000 Kj. 1 2.1 15 portions of grain product x 15= 225 grams 6 portions of fruit x15= 90 grams 6 portions of vegetables x 5g= 30 grams 5 portions of dairy products x 12 = 60 grams Total amount of carbohydrates= 225 +90+ 30+ 60= 405 g 2 2.2 Energy provided by these portions of the carbohydrate supplement is = 405 x 17 kj/g= 6885 Kj 1 3 The energy provided by 405g of carbohydrates is 6885Kj, which is slightly greater than the amount of energy expended by the athlete during his training which is 6000Kj. Hence, the energy requirements are met. 2 3/4

Part of the Ex Correction Mark Exercise 3 (7 points) 1 Hypothesis: Morphine blocks the exocytosis of substance P (pain substance). or Morphine blocks the receptors of substance P (pain substance). or Morphine destroys substance P (pain substance). or Morphine binds to enkephalin receptors causing the same effect. 2 2 Following the stimulation of neuron S only, the pain feeling is intense. On the other hand, after the stimulation of neurons 1 and S, the pain feeling becomes weak and the enkephalin level increases 3 times more from 7 a.u to 20 a.u. This means that the strong secretion of enkephalin by neuron 1 decreased the sensation of pain. So, enkephalin is an analgesic. 1 1/2 3 Following the stimulation of neuron S only, the secretion of enkephalin is 7a.u and the pain feeling is intense. On the other hand, the blockage of enkephalin release (amount = 0 a.u) followed by an injection of morphine into S2 then by a stimulation of neuron S lead to the disappearance of pain sensation. So, morphine blocks the sensation of pain even in the absence of enkephalin, and consequently it is an analgesic substance. 1 1/2 4 The intensity of pain is extreme following the stimulation of neuron S only or following the injection of morphine into the synapse S1 followed by the stimulation of the neuron S (Enkephalin = 7 a.u and substance P = 10 a.u); whereas it shows no pain following the injection of morphine in S2 followed by the stimulation of the neuron S despite the blocking of the release of enkephalin, an analgesic substance, in S2 (Enkephalin = 0 and substance P decreases to zero). So, morphine acts only at the level of S2 enkephalin synapse and acts as enkephalin by decreasing the secretion of substance P and blocking the pain sensation. Therefore, morphine binds to the enkephalin receptors and totally inhibits the exocytosis of substance P which stops the sensation of pain. 2 4/4
