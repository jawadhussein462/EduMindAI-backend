Valuing Natural Resources 1 Water is a critical natural resource upon which all social and economic activities and ecosystem functions depend. Yet, water scarcity- or inadequate amount of water- has become a threat that affects every continent. So far, water use has been growing at a rate more than twice the rate of population increase. Climate change is altering patterns of weather around the world, causing droughts in many regions. 2 Today, around 1.2 billion people, or almost one-fifth of the world's population, live in areas with water scarcity, and 500 million people are approaching this situation. Another 1.6 billion people, or almost one quarter of the world's population, face economic water shortage, where countries lack the necessary means for getting water from rivers. 3 Many variables have been identified as primary sources of water scarcity. There is enough freshwater on the planet for seven billion people, but it is unequally distributed among them, and too much of it is wasted, polluted and wrongly managed. As the world's population grows, pressure on agriculture and farming increases, which demands large amounts of water. Besides, to have enough supply of fresh water, man is changing the course of rivers and building dams, threatening marine life. For instance, some rare species of fish are becoming extinct in some seas and lakes. 4 Sufficient supply of good water quality is needed because it is a key ingredient in the health and well-being of humans, ecosystems and economic development. Nowadays, more than one billion people don't even have enough access to clean water, so they get diseases from polluted water. Although there have been some signs of success in improving water quality, there is no data to suggest that there has been an overall improvement in it on a global scale. 5 With the leadership of strong institutions and governments, a reactive role must be taken especially in water management by directing the way people use it. It is also necessary to use water in a productive way within a conceptual frame of protecting the environment. On the national and local level, the basic facilities of the infrastructure should be supplied with enough money to protect water resources and ensure a fair distribution of water benefits. In addition, individuals have the duty to inform and provide guidance on how to make the use of water resources continue for a long time for future generations to share its many benefits. 6 Accordingly, improving the management of water resources would increase access to safe drinking water to improve the quality of life of billions of individuals. It is also crucial for the 1
