| Part | of | the | exercise | Exercise | 3 | (6.5 | points) | Muscular | Paralysis | in | Worms | Mark | 1 | The | steps | of | the | synaptic | transmission | that | lead | to | muscle | contraction: | 1. | Arrival | of | the | nervous | message | to | the | terminal | buds | of | the | motor | neuron | 2. | Fusion | of | the | secretory | vesicles | containing | the | neurotransmitter, | acetylcholine, | with | the | presynaptic | membrane. | 3. | Exocytosis | of | the | neurotransmitter, | acetylcholine, | into | the | synaptic | cleft. | 4. | Binding | of | acetylcholine | to | the | postsynaptic | receptors | found | on | the | postsynaptic | membrane | of | muscular | cells. | 5. | This | binding | induces | muscle | contraction. | 2 | 2 | The | synapse | is | excitatory | since | the | binding | of | the | neurotransmitter; | acetylcholine, | to | its | specific | postsynaptic | receptors | launches | a | response | at | the | level | of | the | muscle | (contraction). | 1 | 3 | The | injection | of | radioactive | acetylcholine | in | the | synaptic | cleft | leads | to | muscle | contraction | in | both | worms, | the | normal | one | and | the | Unc-13, | and | radioactivity | is | detected | at | the | level | of | postsynaptic | membranes. | This | means | that | the | postsynaptic | receptors | in | Unc-13 | worms | are | sensitive | to | acetylcholine | and | consequently | they | are | normal. | Thus, | the | worm | paralysis | is | not | due | to | a | defect | in | the | postsynaptic | receptors. | 1.5 | 4.1 | Before | the | electric | stimulation, | the | total | number | of | presynaptic | vesicles | which | contain | acetylcholine | is | approximately | the | same | in | both, | the | normal | worm, | 80 | vesicles, | and | the | Unc-13 | worm.75 | vesicles. | However, | after | applying | an | effective | electric | stimulation | on | the | motor | neuron | innervating | the | muscles | in | both | worms, | the | number | of | the | presynaptic | vesicles | in | the | normal | worm | decreases | to | 30 | vesicles, | while | that | in | Unc-13 | worm | remains | the | same, | 75 | vesicles. | 1.5 | 4.2 | The | paralysis | of | Unc-13 | worm | is | due | to | the | absence | of | exocytosis | of | neurotransmitters | (acetylcholine) | in | the | synaptic | cleft. | 0.5 | 4 |
