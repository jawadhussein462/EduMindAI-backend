| Part | of | the | Ex | Exercise | 2 | (6 | points) | Mark | 1 | The | presynaptic | neuron | of | synapse | Si | is | the | neuron | A | and | the | postsynaptic | neuron | is | the | neuron | B. | The | presynaptic | neuron | of | synapse | Szis | the | neuron | B | and | the | postsynaptic | neuron | is | the | neuron | C. | 1.5 | 2 | Synapse | S2 | is | excitatory | since | a | response | of | 4 | APs | of | the | same | amplitude | are | recorded | by | oscilloscope | O | connected | to | neuron | C | (postsynaptic | neuron) | when | neuron | B | (presynaptic | neuron) | is | stimulated. | 1.5 | 3 | The | quantity | of | neurotransmitters | released | by | neuron | A | is | null | whereas, | a | moderate | quantity | of | neurotransmitters | is | released | when | only | neuron | B | is | effectively | stimulated. | This | released | quantity | increases | to | be | moderate | for | neuron | A | and | high | for | neuron | B, | always | greater | than | that | of | A | after | the | simultaneous | stimulation | of | neurons | A | and | B; | this | shows | that | the | action | of | neuron | A | facilitates | the | release | of | neurotransmitters | by | neuron | B | which | is | the | presynaptic | neuron | of | synapse | S2. | This | corresponds | to | a | phenomenon | of | facilitation | where | the | action | of | a | neuron | increases | the | liberation | of | neurotransmitters | by | the | terminal | arborizations | of | sensory | neurons. | 2 | 4 | The | increase | in | the | frequency | of | A.P | in | neuron | C | is | due | to | the | increase | in | the | quantity | of | neurotransmitters | released | by | neuron | B | from | moderate | to | important. | 1 | Parts | of | Ex | Exercise | 3 | (7 | points) | Mark | 1.1 | Volume | of | dioxygen= | 60 | Kg | x | 2.5 | L.kg-1.h-1 | x | 2 | h | = | 300 | L | 1 | 1.2 | Energy | expenditure | = | I.R | x | 20 | KJ/L | Energy | expenditure | = | 300 | Lx | 20 | KJ/L= | 6000 | KJ. | 1 | 2.1 | 15 | portions | of | grain | product | x | 15= | 225 | grams | 6 | portions | of | fruit | x15= | 90 | grams | 6 | portions | of | vegetables | x | 5g= | 30 | grams | 5 | portions | of | dairy | products | x | 12 | = | 60 | grams | Total | amount | of | carbohydrates= | 225 | +90+ | 30+ | 60= | 405 | g | 2 | 2.2 | Energy | provided | by | these | portions | of | the | carbohydrate | supplement | is | = | 405 | x | 17 | KJ/g= | 6885 | KJ | 1 | 3 | The | energy | provided | by | 405g | of | carbohydrates | is | 6885KJ, | which | is | slightly | greater | than | the | amount | of | energy | expended | by | the | athlete | during | his | training | which | is | 6000KJ. | Hence, | the | energy | requirements | are | met. | 2 | 4/4 |
