He indicates that 2016 is expected to be a natural continuation of the status quo, highlighting a number of challenges that must be addressed. He believes that growth in 2015 was about 0.3%, partly due to higher consumption in the first six months of 2015. However, in the absence of investments and the deterioration of the political and security situation, the Lebanese economy is facing challenges, notably controlling the public budget deficit and public debt. According to Aja'a, this is done through the adoption of the budget of 2016, even if it does not contain an economic section, as expenditure contraction and rationalization curb the deficit, in addition to controlling unemployment by providing employment opportunities for young people and stimulating investment through issuing the partnership law between the private and public sectors and tax laws that stimulate investment, and contribute to fighting poverty, that is threatening the middle class, which is the basis of economic growth in countries. المصدر : " النهار" 9 كانون الثاني 2016 - السنة 83 - العدد 25873 2

Document no.2: The economic editor in Al Safir newspaper Adnan Al-Hajj, considers that the fragile security situations in the Arab region as well as inside Lebanon have significantly affected several economic activities in Lebanon. This resulted in a continuous decrease of the three main pillars that stimulate the Lebanese economy; with figures clearly showing the deficit in the economy: 1 - Investments and foreign capital fell during the first eight months of 2015 by more than $ 3 billion, meaning at 33%. This is due to the decrease in foreign remittances. ... The remittances of Lebanese working abroad reached about 6 billion dollars when they were 8.4 billion dollars in the same period last year. The reason is the return of a number of Lebanese working abroad. 2- The problematic political situation decreased the number of Arab visitors especially the GCC citizens 3- The movement of agricultural and industrial exports, as agricultural exports decreased from 200 million to 160 million dollars. The industrial exports declined by 10 percent, as they reached $ 3.4 billion till last August, and are now $ 2.7 billion, while the value of imports exceeds the value of exports in both sectors. The reason for this decline is the closure of the crossings at times, especially the Syrian-Lebanese ones, and thus the increased cost of exports. المصدر: مجلة الجيش - العدد 365 - تشرين الثاني 2015 (بتصرف) Document no.3: ( ... ) As of 1996 the Central Bank launched incentives that benefit from the reduction of required reserve ... , the low-cost money supply stimulus package early 2013 came as a new incentive program for loans for most economic sectors, in an attempt to give a new motivation to the economic growth process through acceptable bank lending interest rates in Lebanese pounds. He added: finally, the Lebanese central bank issued Circular 331, which allows banks and financial institutions to contribute, within 3% of their own funds, in capitalizing emerging projects, business incubators and fast-moving business companies with an activity focused around the information sector. It is a new task for banks to participate in the capital of these companies, which allows them to further contribute in the service of the national economy, in support of intellectual competencies and the owners of professional innovations that fall within the framework of the information economy. المصدر: ورشة عمل في مصرف لبنان عن رسملة الشركات الناشئة - الخميس 19 كانون الأول 2013 .

Second Optional Set: Addressing an Economic Subject (12 points) Document: The extensive layoffs of workers and staff that seem to be "normal daily news" highlight the fear and anxiety of most Lebanese families about the loss of the work of their breadwinner. Some estimate the unemployment rate at 19 percent of the total population reaching up to 35 percent for other parties. A specialized study indicates a rise of 20 percent, especially among young people. Economic experts note that there are many complex factors that are among the main causes of unemployment, including the government's erroneous economic policy, "supporting the service sector at the expense of the agricultural and industrial sectors, and allowing labor and foreign goods to enter the country unchecked." One of the new faces of unemployment is the absence of suitable job opportunities from the labor market for the competencies of educated young people; this is reflected in the surplus in many specializations. The head of the Committee to fight unemployment and the unemployed in Lebanon Rafiq Saabi, stressed that the State is obliged first to seek employment for all citizens, before collecting taxes from them. It is also obliged to address all the repercussions of unemployment, including poverty and the social menaces resulting mostly from the lack of or absence of employment opportunities. Al-Sa'abi proposes steps to address the problem, including: free education and health, establishment of centers in the regions for the rehabilitation of the unemployed, in preparation for their integration into the labor market. المصدر: جريدة السفير - 9-3-2011 Based on the above document and your acquired knowledge: address this issue while extracting the causes of unemployment mentioned in the document, mentioning three of its implications, proposing three solutions to overcome this problem while linking between the reasons and the solutions. 4

Second Optional Part: Addressing an Economic Subject (12 points) Introduction: (3 points) Methodology: The student gets the full mark on the methodology when he mentions the problem and the basic points he will address in the content. Content: Example: Unemployment is a social phenomenon according to which workers do not find work despite their desire to work and their continuous search for opportunities. The disruption of the labor force has several negative effects that lead to a decrease in the purchasing power of citizens and reduced demand for consumption, which will inevitably lead to a decline in investments; thus reduction in economic growth rates. Problematic: Example: How may the State secure employment for all its citizens and how will it address the consequences of unemployment? 2 - Body: (7 points) Methodology: the student should consider the sequence of ideas according to the steps presented in the document while inking paragraphs with transitional sentences. Reasons for unemployment listed in the document: (1 point) - The government's erroneous economic policy, "supporting the service sector at the expense of the agriculture and industry sectors" - "Allowing labor and foreign goods to enter the country unchecked." - "Allowing labor and foreign goods to enter the country unchecked." - "The absence of suitable job opportunities from the labor market for the competencies of educated young people; this is reflected in the surplus in many specializations." Three consequences for unemployment: (3 points) - At the social level: Unemployment leads to a decline in purchasing power, poverty and a decline in the standard of living of the unemployed and those who are responsible for them. They also lead to a decline in the social status they occupy, as well as their tendency towards social delinquency (theft, murder, abuse and promotion of drugs, Etc.). - At the demographic level: unemployment leads to demographic hemorrhage (population decline), which is characterized by an increase in the age of marriage and the rate of celibacy, on one hand, and the low birth rate on the other, leading to massive emigration, especially the brain drain which leads to decrease in productivity - On the economic level: unemployment leads to the waste of human capital;

They also lead to a decline in the social status they occupy, as well as their tendency towards social delinquency (theft, murder, abuse and promotion of drugs, Etc.). - At the demographic level: unemployment leads to demographic hemorrhage (population decline), which is characterized by an increase in the age of marriage and the rate of celibacy, on one hand, and the low birth rate on the other, leading to massive emigration, especially the brain drain which leads to decrease in productivity - On the economic level: unemployment leads to the waste of human capital; which is costly for the State and families that funded the educational preparation of the unemployed who wasn't given the opportunity to contribute to production. Unemployment > decrease in income -> decrease in purchasing power -> decrease in demand for consumption-> Decrease in investment > decrease in production > decrease in economic growth. On the financial level: very expensive and contribute to the rise in the budget deficit especially in countries that pay unemployment benefits for the unemployed 9
