Scientific Discovery of Ocean Salinity 1 Scientific discoveries continuously try to explain the ultimate mystery of nature. Scientists such as Issac Newton, who is considered the greatest scientist of all time, could explain why things fall down and why the planets orbit around the sun through his law of gravity. Other scientists also could explain other mysteries of nature such as why it rains or snows and why ocean water is salty. 2 Through scientific research, scientists could explain that the ocean contains a soup of different minerals found across the surface of the earth, all dissolved into the water. The most common mineral dissolved in ocean water is salt. Salinity is the saltiness or the proportion of dissolved salt to pure water, usually measured in percentage per thousand. Salinity is an important factor in determining many aspects of the chemistry of natural water. 3 Salinity is an ecological factor of considerable importance. It influences the types of organisms that live in a body of water or what species can exist in aquatic environments. 4 Analyzing the salinity of ocean water shows that it varies only slightly from place to place. Nevertheless, some of these small changes are important. There are three basic processes that cause a change in oceanic salinity. One of these is the reduction of water from the ocean by means of evaporation or conversion of liquid water to water vapor. In this manner, the salinity is increased since the salt stays behind. If this is carried to the extreme, of course, white crystals of salt would be left behind. This, by the way, is how much of the table salt we use is actually obtained. 5 The opposite of evaporation is precipitation, such as rain, by which water is added to the ocean. Here, the ocean is being diluted so that the salinity is decreased. This may occur in areas of high rainfall or in coastal regions where rivers flow into the ocean. The freshwater added at the surface reduces the ocean salinity and so makes the seawater less dense. 6 Normally, in tropical regions where the sun is very strong, the ocean salinity is somewhat higher than it is in other parts of the world where there is not as much evaporation. Similarly, in coastal regions where rivers dilute the sea, salinity is somewhat lower than in other oceanic areas. 7 A third process by which water salinity may be altered is associated with the formation and melting of sea ice. When seawater is frozen, the dissolved materials are left behind. In this manner, seawater directly beneath freshly formed sea ice has a higher salinity than it did before the ice appeared. Of course, when this ice melts, it will decrease the salinity of the surrounding water. 8 In the Weddell Sea, on the eastern side of Antarctica, the densest water in oceans is formed as a result of this freezing process, which increases the salinity of cold water. This heavy water sinks and is found in the deeper portions of the oceans of the world. 1

Questions: A- Answer questions 1 to 3 in complete sentences using your own words. 1- According to paragraph 6, in which regions do the oceans generally have more salt? Explain why. (Score:02) 2- According to the selection, what processes decrease ocean salinity? (Score :03) 3- Based on the selection, what does each of the following underlined pronouns refer to?

Each of the following extracts (A and B) is the correct part that completes ONE paragraph in the selection .Read extracts A and B carefully and then choose from paragraphs (1->8) the one that correctly fits with each extract. (Score:02) Extract (A): Thus, salinity is controlled by a balance between water removed by evaporation and freshwater added by rivers and rain. That is why evaporation increases salinity while precipitation and flow of rivers decrease it. Extract (B): Salmon and sea trout are good examples of this as they migrate from sea to freshwater in their life cycle. As well, salinity influences the kinds of plants that will grow either in a water body or on land fed by water. D- Use contextual clues to figure out the meaning of each word in the box below.
