Part 2: Optional Set- First choice set- Analyzing Documents (12 pts.) Document 1: There are social barriers to social change that are clearly visible in traditional societies. The most important of these social obstacles are traditional culture, where social change is largely related to the prevailing culture of society. Thus, traditional culture based on customs, traditions and values in general does not facilitate the process of social change. This is particularly prevalent among older people who have lived in different situations. It was also found that the disruption of the role of women in society would impede the process of social change. In societies with traditional culture, women's illiteracy rate is more than 90%, which limits the effectiveness of women and leads to their marginalization in the development process. The rigid system of social classes also impairs the process of social change, because interaction is limited by class closure. Such a system determines the type of profession individuals must follow and move with. Class cohesion is an impediment to the social mobility process that is prevalent in today's developing societies. مفهوم عوامل التغير الاجتماعي Source: https: crimedz.Logspot.co Document 2: Oxfam, in its report on the 'Index
