What Good Education Means 1 The question about the purpose of good education has worried scholars, teachers and statesmen for a long time. And now as educators prepare young people for their future in a rapidly changing world, the important issue that still worries societies is the question of good education. If you were to ask any teacher, administrator or parent to address the question of purpose of education, it would be difficult to get one answer. The goal of education has been changing with the social, political and economic conditions, and this has always implied different values and concepts about good education. 2 In the past, the educated man was the one well prepared for life. John Henry Newman, in the 19th century, probably best expressed the concept of good education of that time. He believed that good education should produce a complete human being through holistic education that is cultivated not by studying a specific subject but by an enriched education in all branches of knowledge. According to Newman, education should raise the intellectual tone of society, cultivate the public mind, and purify the national taste. It should also help the individual make judgments and express one's opinion. Good education prepares the individual to deal with any subject irrespective of the job. 3 In the 1960s, people's lifestyles and values started to change. The overwhelming demands of the market called for a change to a more practical education. There was a demand for an education that would make students better prepared for the world of business. Thus, the trend was against studying subjects that wouldn't serve that goal. Students would argue that they could be successful doctors, engineers or businessmen, with no need to take courses in literature, psychology or any other subject they weren't interested in. They considered such courses a waste of time and money. Nowadays, universities give students more freedom to choose the courses that would relate much to their interests and preferences. 4 Yet, the debate about the best education remains open as supporters of the traditional education are very worried. They argue that narrow education that concentrates on certain scientific subject matters and ignores humanities will produce robots and not educated people. Nowadays, many people believe that governments and institutions should revise their educational programs and textbooks in an attempt to meet the demands of the 21st century. 5 Despite any dilemma that different opinions and perspectives may pose, healthy debate tends to inspire innovative ideas. However, as we face the challenges of educating young people for the demands of the 21st century, we also know that some issues remain constant. 1
