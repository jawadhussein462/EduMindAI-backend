(7 points) 3- Do you think that man is aware of the reality of his personality? Justify your answer. (4 points) Second subject: (9 points) To be free is to do what we want. 1- Explain this opinion and state the problematic it raises. (9 points) 2- Discuss this opinion in light of other attitudes. (7 points) 3- Do you think that animals are free beings? Justify your answer. (4 points) Third subject: The most important point is that I find in myself countless ideas of things that can't be called nothing, even if they don't exist anywhere outside me. For although I am free to think of these ideas or not, as I choose, I didn't invent them: they have their own true and immutable natures. Even if there are not and never were any triangles outside my thought, still, when I imagine a triangle I am constrained in how I do this, because there is a determinate nature or essence or form of triangle that is eternal, unchanging, and independent of my mind. Consider the things that I can prove about the triangle - that its three angles equal two right angles that its longest side is opposite its greatest angle, and so on. I am forced to agree that the triangle has these properties, even if I didn't give them a thought when the triangle first came into my mind. So they can't have been invented by me. It does not help to point out that I have sometimes seen triangular bodies, so that the idea of the triangle might have come to me from them through my sense organs. I can prove truths about the properties not only of triangles but of countless other shapes that I know I have never encountered through the senses. This understanding is just as clear and distinct as what is involved in mathematical proofs of the properties of shapes and numbers, including arithmetic and geometry. 1. Explain this text of Descartes and state the problematic it raises. (9 points) 2. Discuss the thesis of the text in light of other conceptions on the origin of mathematics. (7 points) 3. Do you think that proficiency in mathematics is a sufficient proof of intelligence? Justify your answer. (4 points)

Introduction: (2 pts.) - The Personality of an individual is a general and comprehensive concept of all its components: psychological, emotional, mental and cultural ... - This personality of this individual is one of the central issues in philosophy, especially in what is related to man. Philosophers tried to define these issues and to reveal their components and measures ... - Philosophers disagreed over these issues. Problematic: (2 pts.) - General problem: (0.5) how is the human personality formed? - Specific problem: (1.5) can the person acquire it from society? Or is it innate, as in born with it? Explanation: (5 pts.) - Preliminary idea: (0.5) the supporters of this social school of thought to which this judgment belongs to has progressed with time. Their most important principle is that the individual is derived from society. Durkheim is one of the founders of this doctrine. - Explanation of the subject: (4 pts.) The human person is a social animal. He/she is raised and lives in a social environment characterized by its own culture. - Society forms its members; in their cultural, mental and psychological conditions. - Durkheim's position: It should also be remembered that social facts are the result of a fusion. As such there is a delicate interplay between the individual and society whereby the individual not only maintains their individuality, but is also able to enrich the field of social forces by contributing to it their own personal thoughts and feelings. - Provide examples: the similarity between the members of one community in the cultural aspect (customs, traditions and tastes .... )

- Presentation of Freud's position: Personality is the product of the relationship between the superego (the social principles represented by the parents in the childhood of their children), and the Id (the instincts the child is born with). - Introducing the basic idea that emphasizes on society that weaving the personality of each of its members. Creativity, coherence, language and consistency (0.5 pt.) Second question: Discussion (7 pts.) Transitional Idea: (0.5 pt.) Despite the reality of the social theory, which is easy to understand, some gaps have emerged as a criticism. Internal criticism: (1pt.) 1. How do we explain then the great differences in personality, between brothers who grew up in the same house and in the same social environment? 2. Don't we find many individuals who have similar personality traits despite their growing in different social environments? External criticism: (3.5 pts.) - Stating different attitudes that consider personality to be the outcome of a person's biological organic structure (typology). - Stating the attitudes of ancient Greek doctors Hippocrates and Galen about the four attitudes that make up the human body and its direct impact on his personality. - Carl Jung's attitude on the two personalities in human beings: introverted and extraverted. - Modern typography: Heiman and his words on the basic characteristics of the subject according to three factors: emotion, activity, reverberation. - Classifications of contemporary psychologists and the diversity of the innate nature. - The morphology theory i.e. the connection between the shape of the skull or the head and the person's character. Synthesis: (1.5 pts.) The human phenomena in general and the individual personality in particular remain insidious to scientific interpretation so far. Therefore, those interested in studying personality try to take advantage of all the theories and try not to exclude any of them for a better approach on the issue. Creativity, coherence, language and consistency (0.5 pt.)

Third question: (4 pts.) Explanation of the question (1 pt.) Justification (2.5 pts.): - The candidate could answer this question affirmatively, negatively, or dialectically, provided that the answer is justified. - The candidate will judge freely: · Either because the human being is characterized by his awareness and the ability to explore the depths of his psychological life and knowledge of all his personal characteristics through introspection. No one knows the individual more than himself or herself ... · Or According to research conducted by Freud that shows man as not being much ignorant about the fact of his personality, which lies outside his consciousness. The need to give illustrative examples.

The need to give illustrative examples. - Creativity, coherence, language and consistency (0.5 pt.) Second Subject: First question: (9 pts.) Introduction (2 pts.): - Freedom as a concept attracted the attention of philosophers, sociologists, politics, religion, poets and writers, which made freedom in general, become an icon of all human actions. - Philosophers tried to define and determine its condition and terms, its dimensions and its source ... - Philosophers ask if the person is free or restrained in his life. - Philosophers disagreed about these titles. Problematic: (2 pts.) - General problem: (0.5 pt.) What is freedom? - Specific problem: (1.5 pts.) Is freedom, to do what one wants without restrictions? Or is freedom bound by conditions and limits that cannot be overcome? Explanation: (5 pts.) -Preliminary idea: (0.5) one of the most prominent philosophers who considered human freedom absolute is the French philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre.

Explanation of the subject: (4 pts.) - The relation of freedom to the will, where man can do what he wants. - The ancients linked the will with knowledge and education, which are the limits of freedom in their point of view. - Freedom of the intellectual, where the meaning of freedom is confined to the absolute freedom of our ideas. - Descartes writes, "It is so obvious that we have a free will that can give its consent or not give it as it sees fit, that it can be counted for one of our most common notions." - Total internal freedom: Stoics. - Existential freedom of J.P. Sartre: Man is determined by his will and existence where man becomes the master of his destiny. - The candidate can speak of freedom according to Hobbes, in the case of nature. Creativity, coherence, language and consistency (0.5 pt.) Second question: Discussion (7 pts.) -Transitional idea: (0.5) although this understanding of freedom has attracted human interest in general, it has many objections and rejections by a majority of philosophers. -Internal criticism: (1 pt.): What is the value of freedom if we do not achieve what we really want? What we really want is not according to our wishes and our will. - Isn't this understanding of freedom of the human being closer to that of the animal who does what it believes for survival without any attention to the existence of others? - External criticism: (3.5 pts.) - Most philosophers rejected this understanding of freedom because man is a rational and social being where his freedom stands at the limits of freedom of the other - Freedom is doing what we want, provided we do not break the laws prevailing in society: Rousseau. - Spinoza's attitude of freedom: the theory of necessity - The theory of determinism and freedom: the concept of freedom has been replaced by the concept of emancipation, where man is gradually freed from the natural constraints through scientific discoveries as well as social obligations through sociology and psychological obligations through psychoanalysis.

- Synthesis: (1.5) The interest of people in all these categories in the concept of freedom is an evidence of its importance and its great role in human life. The array of attitudes and theories about freedom is a healthy aspect because it opened a wide horizon for man to approach this mystery that puzzled many philosophers and scientists. Creativity, coherence, language and consistency (0.5 pt.)

That means that it is very far from freedom. The need to give illustrative examples. - Creativity, coherence, language and consistency (0.5 pt.) Third subject: Text First question: (9 pts.) Introduction: (2 pts.): - Introducing mathematics and talking about its importance and credibility. - Attracting mathematics to the attention of scientists and philosophers for accuracy, coherence and credibility. - According to Descartes' classical conception, mathematics is the science of order, measure, and accuracy. Philosophers questioned their nature and origin. They disagreed about these titles. Problematic (2 pts.):

- General problem: (0.5) - What is the origin and source of mathematical principles? - Specific problem: (1.5) - Is mathematics pure reasoning? Or is it derived from sensory experience? Explanation: (5 pts.) - Preliminary idea: (0.5 pt.) This text belongs to the rational school of thought which is one of the greatest schools in the history of philosophy. The most important principle is that all human knowledge stems from reason. The most important philosophers are Plato and Descartes (author of this text) and Kant. Explanation of the text: (4 pts.): - Definition of thesis of the text: The mind is the source of mathematics. - Identification of key ideas: - The innate thoughts. - The presence of elements of mathematics in the mind. - Examples. - The text begins by pointing to the existence of many ideas in the mind, and this presence is real and cannot be considered as nothing because it is not present in the external world, but it is a fact fixed and clear. - These ideas are not man-made and are innate in his mind. Descartes' statement elsewhere in the text indicates that God placed these thoughts in the human mind. - Rationalist philosophers (Plato-Descartes-Kant) consider that mathematical concepts are 'a priori' principles. The candidate can address what some philosophers have said in this regard. The mathematical concept is the complete idea that the mathematician grasps and follows in his operations through it (the idea of a triangle is that which allowed me to know it and not because it actually exists). - Mathematical concepts are of a mental nature itself. The sensory experience does not give us lines stripped of their width and density, nor numbers independent of things. - Plato: Talk about the world of ideas that includes mathematical ideas. - Descartes: Talk about the innate principles found in the human mind (the principles of mathematics are present in the mind by readiness and susceptibility). - Galileo: The mathematical properties do not come from the world, but from us. - Kant: Mathematics concepts a priori included in the mind as the concepts of place and time.

- Descartes adds that, if we assume that the triangle exists in reality there are countless forms that have not been in absolutely in my senses: such as numbers and other things related to calculation and engineering: fractions, infinity and engineering circles ... - The candidate can state some of the arguments and proofs by which philosophers emphasized that the principles of mathematics stems from the mind. Creativity, coherence, language and consistency (0.5 pt.) Second question: Discussion (7 pts.) - Transitional idea: (0.5) although most scholars and philosophers adopted the position of the rationalists of mathematics, they have emerged in the last century positions that shook this position. - Internal criticism: (1 pt.): 1- The emergence of mathematical systems, not Euclidean, was a fatal blow to the rationalist doctrine: If the mind was programmed on the principles of mathematics, how can the mind imagine postulates and paradoxes contradictory? Can the mind contradict itself? How can the mind conceive, in geometry, a flat place and a place that is oppressed negatively or positively and based on a

 that have not been in absolutely in my senses: such as numbers and other things related to calculation and engineering: fractions, infinity and engineering circles ... - The candidate can state some of the arguments and proofs by which philosophers emphasized that the principles of mathematics stems from the mind. Creativity, coherence, language and consistency (0.5 pt.) Second question: Discussion (7 pts.) - Transitional idea: (0.5) although most scholars and philosophers adopted the position of the rationalists of mathematics, they have emerged in the last century positions that shook this position. - Internal criticism: (1 pt.): 1- The emergence of mathematical systems, not Euclidean, was a fatal blow to the rationalist doctrine: If the mind was programmed on the principles of mathematics, how can the mind imagine postulates and paradoxes contradictory? Can the mind contradict itself? How can the mind conceive, in geometry, a flat place and a place that is oppressed negatively or positively and based on a coherent and honest mathematical system? 2- If the principles of mathematics are innate in the mind of man, why man was delayed thousands of years to discover? External Criticism: (3.5 pts.) - Demonstrate the inadequacy of the rationalist theory. - The primacy of sensory experience. The truth is not independent of sensory experience, but it is a subsidiary and stems from it. The Attitudes of some Experimental Philosophers: John Locke (if mathematics was innate, why don't the children understand it and the goofs) John Stewart Mill (man saw the circle in the pupil of the eyes and the tree logs and the straight line in the horizon and the path of rain). - Mathematical concepts are facts derived directly from sensory experience and from observation. It is important to present some of the empirical arguments: Mathematics in ancient civilizations began in the practical needs of the population before they became theoretical. The counting began on the fingers before the appearance of the decimal system based on the number of fingers ... Synthesis: (1.5 pts.) The rational theory as well as the empirical theory faced great difficulties in the origin of the principles of mathematics, especially after the emergence of non-classical mathematical systems,

where the theory of one of these two theories is almost impossible. This led to a new attitude beyond the two traditional theories, which is the operational position that considered the principles of mathematics not mental or experimental. It is the result of agreement among people to adopt these principles because they help them to run their daily affairs. The reason for the predominance of Euclid's system is due to its simplicity and ease of use and its practicality in solving the problems facing man. Creativity, coherence, language and consistency (0.5 pt.) Third question: (4 points) - Explanation of the question (1 pt.) - Justification (2.5 pts.): - The candidate could answer this question affirmatively, negatively or dialectically, provided that the answer is justified. - The candidate will judge freely: · Either if intelligence is limited to mental ability; there is no doubt that skill in mathematics is sufficient evidence of intelligence. · Or If intelligence is of several types, as most psychologists say, skill in mathematics shows one kind of intelligence and evidence that the geniuses in mathematics are almost stupid in social relations (social intelligence) and also lack motor intelligence, music, vocational and technical. ... The need to give illustrative examples. Creativity, coherence, language and consistency (0.5 pt.)
