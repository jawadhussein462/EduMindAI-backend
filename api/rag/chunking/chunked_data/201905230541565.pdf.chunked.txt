| 6 | The | tree | of | life | is | a | widespread | motif | in | many | myths | and | folktales | around | the | world, | by | which | cultures | sought | to | understand | the | human | conditions | on | earth. | Many | legends | speak | of | a | tree | of | life, | which | grows | above | the | ground | and | symbolizes | life | on | earth. | It | has | often | been | linked | with | nourishing | people's | life | with | fruit | and | providing | shelter | for | them. | It | is | probably | the | most | ancient | human | myth | and | is | possibly | a | universal | one. | 7 | The | tree | of | life | was | often | considered | the | center | of | the | world | that | bound | people | and | represented | a | vital | connection | between | the | world | and | humans. | In | some | traditions, | the | tree | was | seen | as | the | source | of | fertility | and | life. | Thus, | it | was | believed | that | human | life | was | influenced | by | trees. | For | example, | the | tree's | fruit | was | believed | to | confer | an | everlasting | life. | It | was | also | thought | that | if | the | tree | had | been | cut | down, | all | fertility | would | have | ceased. | Moreover, | the | tree | of | life | occurred | commonly | in | romantic | stories | as | a | haven | for | characters. | 8 | However, | the | symbols | used | in | language, | folklore | and | culture | serve | as | reminders | of | the | rich | relationship | between | human | thought | and | the | world | of | forests. | Modern | concerns | about | conserving | the | forests | are | perhaps | a | natural | extension | of | the | logic | of | ancient | tree | rites. | Yesterday's | sacred | wood | is | today | a | biosphere | reserve, | a | natural | heritage | site | or | a | protected | area. | Pondering | deeply | about | the | symbolic | realm | can | help | explain | the | links | between | ancient | value | systems | and | modern | practices. | Questions: | A- | Answer | each | of | the | following | questions | in | 1-4 | sentences | using | your | own | words. | 1- | How | does | the | writer | introduce | trees | in | paragraph | 1? | (Score: | 03) | 2- | Based | on | paragraph | 2, | how | have | people's | perceptions | of | trees | changed | over | time? | (Score: | 03) | 3- | According | to | paragraphs | 3 | and | 4, | how | can | you | describe | people's | perceptions | of | trees | in | prehistoric | societies? | Explain. | (Score: | 03) | 4- | Based | on | paragraphs | 6 | and | 7, | how | is | "tree | of | life" | linked | to | human | survival? | (Score: | 03) | 5- | What | message | does | the | writer | imply | in | paragraph | 8? | (Score: | 03) | B- | 1- | Identify | one | figure | of | speech | in | paragraph | 5 | and | explain | its | function. | (Score: | 03) | 2- | What | cohesive | device | does | the | writer | use | to | link | paragraphs | 6 | and | 7? | (Score: | 03) | 3- | How | are | paragraphs | 3 | and | 4 | thematically | related? | Explain. | (Score: | 03) | 4- | What | two | types | of | audience, | other | than | the | general | reader, | might | be | interested | in | reading | the | selection? | Explain | the | interest | of | each. | (Score: | 03) | C- | The | following | statements | are | false | because | they | misinterpret | what | is | stated | or | implied | in | the | selection | above. | Rewrite | them
