| democratic | institutions | and | practices. | 4 | One | broad | concept | that | is | central | to | democratic | practices | and | peacebuilding | is | constitution | making, | which | is | part | of | UN | global | efforts. | It | ranges | from | drafting | a | new | constitution | to | reforming | an | existing | one. | Both | processes | are | needed | for | the | success | of | constitution-making, | which | presents | a | great | opportunity | to | create | a | common | vision | of | the | future | of | a | country, | the | results | of | accomplishing | them | have | a | profound | and | lasting | impact | on | democracy, | peace | and | stability. | In | particular, | the | inclusion | of | commitments | in | peace | agreements | to | address | ethnic, | regional | or | political | tensions | in | a | constitutional | framework | can | be | a | vital | element | in | consolidating | peace. | Similarly, | provisions | to | reform | national | systems | can | provide | an | important | platform | for | efforts | to | strengthen | democracy | and | the | rule | of | law. | 5 | The | United | Nations | provides | a | wide | variety | of | election-related | technical | assistance | to | requesting | Member | States. | In | electoral | assistance | activities, | it | tries | to | ensure | organizational | coherence | and | political | and | technical | consistency | in | electoral | activities. | A | coordination | mechanism | has | been | established | with | relevant | United | Nations | departments, | agencies | and | programs | involved | in | electoral | assistance. | 1 |
