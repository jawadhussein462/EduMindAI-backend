WHY UNICEF 1 "The water filled the boat up till my knees. I was sitting on a man's lap, and afraid for my mother, knowing the back pain she suffers from. I was afraid the boat might collapse in the middle and we would sink into the sea and die. I was afraid for my mother, and my mother was afraid for me," said Malak, a seven-year old girl. 2 Sixty-five million children around the world are on the move - running from conflict, poverty and extreme weather - looking for a place to call home and a better life. They are among the most vulnerable people on earth; children on the edge. It is unlikely that these numbers will fall, so we are expecting one of the greatest disasters of our age. 3 In this crisis, children are the most vulnerable. Many are travelling with their families, and many others are on their own. Every one of them is in need of protection and entitled to the rights guaranteed under the Convention on the rights of the Child. 4 In many cases, migrants might experience different types of violence and abuse, each with their own characteristics. While moving to other countries, migrant children and women, especially those without documentation, are vulnerable to trafficking and exploitation. 5 Conflicts and natural disasters that are the major reasons why children move to safe places can be significantly harmful to their psychosocial well-being and development. Exposure to violence, disaster, loss of, or separation from family members and friends, deterioration in living conditions, inability to provide for one's self and family and lack of access to services can all have immediate and long-term consequences for children, families and communities and impair their ability to function and be fulfilled. 6 Changes in legislation, policies, services and social norms can improve the protection of children in multiple ways. UNICEF is working on the ground to ensure that programs and policies in response to this crisis put the rights and needs of all children first. It is also working to expand humanitarian services wherever they are needed on refugees' routes, including providing water, age-appropriate food and establishing special spaces, where children can play and women can rest and take care of their babies. 7 UNICEF works with partners on a number of issues by strengthening child protection systems and promoting positive social norms in all contexts to prevent and respond to violence, exploitation and abuse directed at children. With its partners, UNICEF provides different kinds of psychosocial support to help children during emergency situations overcome such difficult 1

experiences. Some include organizing culturally and age appropriate, safe and stimulating activities such as sports and games to develop life skills and coping mechanisms. UNICEF uses child-friendly spaces for organizing activities in stimulating environments where affected children can feel safe. It also provides specialized referral services for children with behavioural issues so that they receive appropriate networks of professional care. 8 To strengthen the ability of community members to support their children, families and neighbours, UNICEF could disseminate key messages on how to cope with emergency situations through a variety of channels including the media, religious organizations, existing community structures and youth groups. 9 At the same time, there are still millions caught in situations of conflict, displacement, poverty and underdevelopment and UNICEF remains committed to supporting sustainable solutions where they are needed most.

In delivering humanitarian results for children, UNICEF recognizes that meaningful and effective engagement with affected populations is central to their survival and recovery. The organization will therefore focus on initiatives that further strengthen its ability to link its development and humanitarian mandates by helping communities reduce the risks and impacts of natural disasters and conflicts at many levels.
