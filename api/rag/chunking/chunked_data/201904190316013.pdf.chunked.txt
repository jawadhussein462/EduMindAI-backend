(4 points) Third subject: Text Feeling gives rise to the experimental idea or hypothesis, i.e., the previsioned interpretation of natural phenomena. The whole experimental enterprise comes from the idea, which induces experiment. Reason or reasoning serves only to deduce the consequences of this idea and to submit them to experiment. An anticipative idea or a hypothesis is, then, the necessary starting point for all experimental reasoning. Without it, we could not make any investigation at all nor learn anything; we could only pile up sterile observations. If we experimented without a pre-conceived idea, we should move at random ... The idea once set forth, we can only explain how to submit it to the definite precepts and precise rules of logic from which no experimenter may depart; but its appearance is wholly spontaneous, and its nature is wholly individual. A particular feeling, a quid proprium (what is proper) constitutes the originality, the inventiveness, or the genius of each man. A new idea appears as a new or unexpected relation, which the mind perceives among things. 1- Explain this text of Claude Bernard and state the problematic it raises. (9 points) 2- Discuss the thesis of this text in light of the points of view that emphasize the importance of the observation in the experimental method. (7 points) 3- Do you think that the evolution of artificial intelligence would be a threat to humanity? Justify your answer. (4 points)

Introduction (2 pts.) الهيئة الأكاديميّة المشتركة قسم: الفلسفة المركز التربوي للبحوث والإنماء أسس التصحيح: - The Good is all that the world has to do. - The Good is a standard concept to which we return to, to define the positive or negative value of the human conduct. By reviewing the various theories concerning the moral good, we perceive a great diversity of determinations of the basic aspiration. Problematic (2 pts.) - General problem (0.5 pt.): What is the norm that defines the value of our actions? - Specific problem (1.5 pts.): Can one say that supreme happiness is the only criterion for the Good? Or are there other equally important criteria? Thesis (5 pts.) - Preliminary idea (0.5 pt.): Indeed, this subject deals with the eudemonistic point of view with regard to the good. - Explanation of the judgment (4 pts.): - Aristotle affirms, "All men desire to be happy". - The search for happiness is an activity proper to man because of the essential faculty in him, which is reason. To attain happiness, man must acquire speculative virtues belonging to the mental activity, which is the noblest in man. - Virtues are means to achieve the success of life, happiness. - Creativity, coherence, language and consistency (0.5 pt.)

Second question: Discussion (7 pts.) - Transitional idea (0.5 pt.): However, it is true that absolute happiness can help to accomplish good, but this thesis has encountered several difficulties. - Internal criticism (1 pt.): · This method of seeking happiness seems unreal and inaccessible in the earthly life. · Why minimize the role of earthly pleasures that man has from birth. - External criticism (3.5 pts.): (The candidate can choose any other theory that deals with the Good to discuss the eudemonist theory and point of view) · For the hedonist, the fundamental norm of the goodness of an act, in other words, the supreme good, is pleasure. · The representatives of the hedonistic theory are Aristippus of Cyrene and Epicurus. · For the utilitarian, the good act is the one that is useful to realize the pleasure and to increase the happiness of the community. . For the morals of social feeling, the standard rules of ethics refer to altruistic feeling. · For Kant, the standard rules of ethics refer to the good intention of the will that leads man to act out of duty. - Synthesis (1.5 pt.): - The multiplicity of theories concerning the moral good and the value reveals some real divergences in the adopted fundamental conceptions of man. - However, it is clearly remarkable that the various theories agreed on the following conclusion: the human mind is characterized by a moral activity on the alert. - Creativity, coherence, language and consistency (0.5 pt.)

Third question: (4 pts.) - Explanation of the question (1 pt.) - Justification (2.5 pts.): - The candidate could answer this question affirmatively negatively or dialectically, provided that the answer is justified. - The candidate will judge freely: · The happiness of the whole society is possible if the efforts are combined and if the authority plans in the long term and adopts the values of the good .... · It is impossible to ensure the happiness of an entire society and the theory of the virtuous city preached by the ancient philosophers has fallen ... - Creativity, coherence, language and consistency (0.5 pt.) Second subject: First question: (9 pts.) Introduction (2 pts.) - Right is born from the necessity to regulate relations between men. - It is considered an effort to bring man to a normal situation, contrary to his egoism, by means of righteous rules that apply to all. - Philosophers have agreed on the concept of law to regulate human relations, but do not agree on the principle of its establishment. Problematic (2 pts.) - General problem (0.5 pt.): What is the basis of Law? - Specific problem (1.5 pts.): Is positive law the source of power? Or does the force establish the right?

Problematic (2 pts.) - General problem (0.5 pt.): What is the basis of Law? - Specific problem (1.5 pts.): Is positive law the source of power? Or does the force establish the right?

Thesis (5 pts.) - Preliminary idea (0.5 pt.): Indeed, this judgment follows from the principle that the law is a set of rules that govern the life of society and it derives from a legislative authority known as positive law. - Explanation of the judgment (4 pts.): - Practically, in every organized society, the law is recognized as a systematic set of rules that govern life in society. - The rules set about, in a given state, constituted of the legislative power, which apply them by the executive power and the judicial power. They constitute "positive law". - Rousseau establishes the right from a social contract resulting from the combined efforts of the whole society and rejects force as a source of law. - Give examples of everyday life ... - Creativity, coherence, language and consistency (0.5 pt.) Second question: Discussion (7 pts.) - Transitional idea (0.5 pt.): However, despite the importance of positive law for the establishment of justice in society, this principle has raised many objections. - Internal criticism (1 pt.): · If positive law is the most appropriate, what is the reason for instability in the countries that apply it? · How can we explain the difference in legislation between countries explained, and what results from inequalities and injustices between citizens? - External criticism (3.5 pts.): - Thomas Hobbes, and his contemporary Spinoza, have openly limited the natural state of man to a primitive state in which he behaves exclusively like an animal, led by fierce selfishness. - Men are driven by appetite and desire, and they tend violently to get their hand on all material goods and to seize power, in a merciless war of all against all. Hobbes argues that, by fear of death, and by a natural instinct of self-preservation, the weakest of men give up all their rights to one of them in order to bring order.

- In this political state, the sovereign maintains himself in power until the day when someone overthrows him by force and seizes the power to maintain himself by force and become, in his turn, the absolute master. ... - Give examples of everyday life ... - Synthesis (1.5 pts.): · The essence of the law is to be a tool of peace between human beings and to establish legal and emotional links between them. · The law leads people to live together in an atmosphere of peace and tranquility. · It is necessary to continue to seek the right that offers the greatest degree of justice and equality between human beings. - Creativity, coherence, language and consistency (0.5 pt.) Third question: (4 pts.) - Explanation of the question (1 pt.) - Justification (2.5 pts.): - The candidate could answer this question affirmatively, negatively, or dialectically, provided that the answer is justified. - The answer can be: · Affirmative: Law enforcement is often the guarantying of social justice: laws are designed to be applied equally and thus ensure justice ... · Negative: As time goes on, laws can change from guarantor to destroyer of justice. Society is constantly evolving and laws can be transformed into obsolete traditions that cannot cope with this evolution. - Creativity, coherence, language and consistency (0.5 pt.) Third subject: First question: (9 pts.) Introduction (2 pts.)

- Knowledge is what distinguishes man from all other living beings of nature, which allows him to rise gradually from the level of these beings and to move away from them. - The sources of knowledge are numerous, common knowledge, religious knowledge, philosophical knowledge and scientific knowledge, which is the subject of the discussion in this subject. - This text raises the question about the most important step of the scientific method. Problematic (2 pts.) - General problem (0.5 pt.): What is the most important step in the experimental method? - Specific problem (1.5 pt.): Can we consider the scientific hypothesis as a fundamental and indispensable stage of the scientific method?

- Knowledge is what distinguishes man from all other living beings of nature, which allows him to rise gradually from the level of these beings and to move away from them. - The sources of knowledge are numerous, common knowledge, religious knowledge, philosophical knowledge and scientific knowledge, which is the subject of the discussion in this subject. - This text raises the question about the most important step of the scientific method. Problematic (2 pts.) - General problem (0.5 pt.): What is the most important step in the experimental method? - Specific problem (1.5 pt.): Can we consider the scientific hypothesis as a fundamental and indispensable stage of the scientific method? Does the observation have the same importance? - Preliminary idea (0.5 pt.): Indeed, Claude Bernard, in this text, affirms that the hypothesis is an indispensable step in any scientific experiment and without it, no sure result can be assured. - Explanation of the text (4 pts.): Claude Bernard, at the beginning of this text, asserts that the entire experimental method is based on the idea (the hypothesis), without which the scientist does not reach any acceptable result. - The secondary ideas that he cited as strong arguments are summarized as follows: · Without hypothesis, the scientist limits himself to gathering sterile observations that do not give positive results. · If he experiments without a hypothesis, his experiment will be an adventure that does not lead to sure results. · Therefore, it is inevitable to produce the hypothesis that must be subject to certain logical rules to be valid, but the development of the hypothesis in the mind of the scientist is spontaneous, and this is what distinguishes the learned genius from the others. · For example, Einstein was the least qualified among his classmates, but his hypothesis on the law of relativity made him a genius something his colleagues could not achieve. · The last idea Bernard addresses in this text is that the hypothesis is a new construction of the relations between the elements of the event, which was not previously known; it comes to resolve the ambiguity and confusion created by observation. (The learner will use his skills to explain and enrich the text) - Creativity, coherence, language and consistency (0.5 pts.)

Second question: Discussion (7 pts.) - Transitional Idea (0.5 pt.): Even though, it is true that the hypothesis is a very important in the experimental approach, this scientific step is not enough to pass to the experiment: - Internal criticism (1 pt.): · How can the scientist construct a hypothesis without observing the scientific event? · Most scientific laws are developed from observation as Newton's law of gravity. - External criticism (3.5 pts.): - The observation of the natural event is the first step. - The observation must be quantitative and precise. - Observation can be done with the naked eye, but there is not much left to watch in this way. Scientists are turning to advanced techniques of observation. - The most important step in the observation is that the scientist considers the event as a scientific question to be solved. - The events to be observed are those that involve a discussion. - Synthesis (1.5 pt.): - Despite the importance of the two stages (observation and hypothesis), experiment alone makes it possible to construct a scientific law. It is impossible to speak of the most important step, for the nature of the phenomenon studied is that which determines to the scientist which of the two stages is the most suitable. In addition to observation, hypothesis, and experiment, scientific law requires the ability to convert mental interpretations into algebraic equations, that is, into mathematical language. - Creativity, coherence, language and consistency (0.5 point) Third question: (4 pts.)

- Explanation of the question (1 pt.) - Justification (2.5 pts.): - The candidate could answer this question affirmatively, negatively, or dialectically, provided that the answer is justified. - The answer can be: · Positive: The evolution of science in the field of artificial intelligence will make man a consumer, unable to provide for himself without the machine. The development of artificial intelligence can become a disaster for man if he manages to create a robot out of the control of the inventor. · Negative: Until now, the machine has facilitated human life and the idea of destroying humanity by robots exists in science fiction movies: a man with the intelligence to invent a robot is able to destroy it at any time. - Creativity, coherence, language and consistency (0.5 pt.)
