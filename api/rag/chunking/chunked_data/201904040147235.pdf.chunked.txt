The use of non-programmable calculators is allowed. Exercise 1 (61/2 points) Lebanon's beaches, an environmental disaster in the making Witnessing tourists and locals alike flock to Beirut's beaches in large swathes has become a thing of the past, for many reasons. The most obvious one is pollution and the ever-increasing bacteria levels in the water as a result of the country's inability to properly manage its waste. It's sewage waste specifically, and one of its sources stands right next to the public beach in Ramlet-El-Bayda, a dismal complex of submarine pipes which pumps untreated waste directly into the sea. A toxicology report, put together by the Lebanese Agricultural Research Institute, found alarmingly high concentrations of chemical and bacterial contamination, including large levels of mercury, copper, lead, and cadmium. "By Georgi Azar and Zeina Nasser, Source: Annahar 8 July 2018" Questions: 1) Wastes are the origin of a phenomenon called "pollution". Define pollution. 2) There are two types of pollutants. 2-1) Give the name of each of these two types. 2-2) Specify the type that is more dangerous. 3) The sewage waste is the main source of water pollution in Ramlet-El-Bayda. 3-1) Pick up, from the text, the names of two pollutants and specify their harmful effect on the human health. 3-2) Indicate the effect of these pollutants on the aquatic life. 4) According to the text, human health is in danger. The seriousness of the situation requires to reduce the pollution that affects air, water and the soil. Give a way in order to limit pollution in each medium. Exercise 2 (7 points) Radioactivity of cadmium 113 Cadmium is a heavy metal present in soil, air, and water and is listed as a priority pollutant. Cadmium toxicity in humans is caused by smoking, inhalation of dust and fumes, and by contaminated food. Naturally occurring, cadmium (48Cd) is composed of 8 isotopes, the 113Cd Mass being a beta minus (ß") emitter. Given: 1 keV = 1.6×10-16 J; Speed of light in vacuum c = 3×108 m/s. 1) Define the isotope of an element. 2) The B" radiation, a type of radioactivity, is associated to a particle. 2-1) Give the name of this particle. 2-2) Give a reason why this radiation is dangerous. 3) The decay of 113Cd is represented in (Doc. 1). mo 8 16 24 32 (Doc.1) V t (×1015 years) 3-1) Define the half-life T of a radioactive substance. 3-2) Determine, referring to (Doc. 1), the value of the half-life T of 113Cd. 1/2

3-3) A sample of 113Cd has a mass mo = 8 g at the instant to = 0. Find the remaining mass of this sample at the instant t = 3T. 4) The radio-nuclide 113C 148Cd decays into Indium (In) according to the equation: 113 48Cd -> 2In + ··· Complete the equation, indicating the used laws. 5) The decay of a 113Cd nucleus liberates an amount of energy of 320.34 keV. 5-1) Convert, in joules, the value of this energy. 5-2) Calculate the corresponding mass lost. Exercise 3 (61/2 points) If the planets were fruits The solar system is composed of the Sun and the group of celestial bodies that orbit around it due to its gravitational pull. The planets were compared, in relative size, using pieces of

3-3) A sample of 113Cd has a mass mo = 8 g at the instant to = 0. Find the remaining mass of this sample at the instant t = 3T. 4) The radio-nuclide 113C 148Cd decays into Indium (In) according to the equation: 113 48Cd -> 2In + ··· Complete the equation, indicating the used laws. 5) The decay of a 113Cd nucleus liberates an amount of energy of 320.34 keV. 5-1) Convert, in joules, the value of this energy. 5-2) Calculate the corresponding mass lost. Exercise 3 (61/2 points) If the planets were fruits The solar system is composed of the Sun and the group of celestial bodies that orbit around it due to its gravitational pull. The planets were compared, in relative size, using pieces of fruit in an image using data from an episode of the BBC's "Stargazing Live". The Earth is a cherry tomato compared to massive Jupiter's watermelon. Mercury = Peepercorn Mars = Blueberry Saturn = Grapefruit Jupiter = Watermelon Venus = Grape Uranus = Apple Neptune = Lime Earth = Cherry tomato (Doc. 2) 1) The planets of the solar system are classified into two groups. 1-1) Give the name of each of these two groups. 1-2) Name two planets of each group. 2) Jupiter has 16 moons 4 of which can be observed clearly by a medium sized telescope. 2-1) Name the scientist who made the first telescope designed for astronomical observation. 2-2) Indicate a way to observe the other 12 moons of Jupiter. 3) The asteroids of the solar system form a belt. 3-1) Define an asteroid. 3-2) Indicate the position of the asteroids belt. 4) The table below shows the radii of the planets of our solar system. Complete the table below, referring to (Doc. 2), to match each planet to its corresponding radius. Radius (km) 6378 6052 2440 60330 71400 25560 3397 24764 Planet 2/2
