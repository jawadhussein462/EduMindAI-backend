Document 1: Culture has an effective and decisive influence on the quality of the values and norms that form that culture. Consequently, it has a decisive impact on the patterns of behavior practiced by individuals. If education means quoting knowledge from the treasures of culture in order to succeed in life and then live harmoniously in our being and our society, then this knowledge consists of a pattern of values that must be represented by individuals if they wish to be in harmony with the environment to which they belong.

They differ according to the nature of the values that constitute their social fabric. Culture plays a key role in the transmission and promotion of the culture of the society. Educators and work in the field of education should quickly clarify the cultural framework in which a person moves. The relationship between culture and educational values is a close relationship that cannot be dissected. Educational values must have roots that draw their foundations and their general perception. These roots are culture. المصدر: د.عبد المجيد بن مسعود "القيم التربوية والثقافية العلاقة بين القيم التربوية والثقافية" 2017 بتصرف Document 2: The importance of the values and the trends that educational institutions try to instill in the learner emerge through the curriculum and extra-curricular activities and considered as an exemplary represented by teachers and principals for students which are mainly serving the formation of scientific and social skills of the learner. Without forgetting the social role of other institutions in this field especially the family and institutions of civil society, and media institutions ... and others ( ... ). Values are considered to be a socio-cultural capital inherited throughout generations, although some change with time or with changing circumstances. There is continuity in the system of values and this is essential in education, which is a planned and purposeful work. Thus, values remain with the student and conform with his personality and his actions and the standard by which he rules on his actions as well as actions of others. المصدر: د.نمر فريحة "من المواطنية الى التربية المواطنية: سيرورة وتحديات بيبلوس2012 بتصرف Document 3: The educational system is an essential component of sustainable human development, despite the relative independence of education and development as two different fields of knowledge. Therefore, countries have directed their educational policies according to the new liberal ideologies, so that the educational system serves this ideology. In the case of Lebanon, this relationship takes place within the framework of a traditional system linked to a system of values and traditional social structures (family, sectarian ... ) that interact with a modern system of values. This relationship creates a fundamental problematic between expansion and openness on the one hand and traditional structures on the other. The weakness of state institutions and the law and the active presence of traditional sectarian entities have been reflected in the absence of developmental plans and comprehensive educational policies. This reality has resulted in wide inequalities between the Lebanese people in the field of education ... These inequalities are linked to the type of education distributed between private and non-free education, in which affordable social groups are particularly accessible, and with general public education, in which a large number of poor groups participate in particular. Thus, education becomes international and official degrees in private sectors, as well as Lebanese curricula in the public sphere only. This is the result of the absence of a common system and the absence

of a comprehensive educational policy, which led to lack of social cohesion, educational selection of the elites and weakness in the unique national identity. المصدر: د.علي الموسوي التربية والتنمية البشرية المستدامة بتصرف By referring to the 3 given documents, answer the following questions: 1.

Document 1: A study of the status of women at work shows a decline in the number of women working in the educational sector in the younger and middle age groups compared to the older age group. We believe that the great diversity of the university and professional specialties that are available on one hand and which the students are moving toward have expanded the work circle and increased the type of career opportunities. However, women still suffer from unequal employment conditions and the same job as in social allowances and pay.

In today's society, parents are equating females with males in education, which allowed women to progress in education to reach the top of the educational pyramid, namely the university, which increased their self-confidence. However, women in our society still face domestic violence in various forms (verbal / mental / physical and psychological violence). Many of these women do not have the courage to announce it.
