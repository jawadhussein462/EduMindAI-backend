| Second | Optional | Set: | Writing | an | Economic | Essay | (12 | points) | Document | no.1: | The | potential | for | rapid | privatization | of | the | electricity | sector | will | remain | limited | due | to | the | current | status | of | Electricité | du | Liban | (EDL). | What | should | be | done | in | this | regard | is | an | immediate | and | serious | action | to | put | an | end | to | the | effects | and | serious | financial | repercussions | of | EDL | on | the | State's | budget | and | employees | ( | ... | ) | Despite | the | fact | that | the | approved | tariffs | are | not | considered | low | compared | to | regional | standards, | the | total | losses | of | EDL | are | high. | The | government | is | forced | to | cover | EDL's | net | losses | in | addition | to | the | public | debt | service | and | capital | expenditure | of | this | institution, | which | amounted | to | about | US | $ | 1 | billion | in | 2006, | representing | 3.5% | of | the | gross | domestic | product | in | the | fiscal | year | of | 2006. | In | contrast, | the | investment | requirements | in | this | sector | for | the | next | five | years | are | estimated | to | be | about | $ | 1.5 | billion. | In | light | of | the | increasing | demand | for | energy | consumption, | the | private | sector, | rather | than | the | public | sector, | needs | to | secure | the | required | investments | and | services | in | the | future, | due | to | the | high | public | debt | burden | underpinning | the | public | sector. | المصدر: | المؤتمر | الدولي | لدعم | لبنان، | 25 | كانون | الثاني | 2007، | باريس | 2 | Document | no.2: | Among | the | reasons | for | the | increase | in | the | problem | of | rationing | in | electricity | is | the | large | difference | between | the | production | and | the | demand, | as | demand | reached | 3150 | megawatts, | while | the | plants | can | produce | 1600 | to | 1700 | megawatts | at | best; | in | addition | to | continuous | faults | in | the | production | plants, | the | shortage | in | stations | and | transmission | lines, | the | infringements | of | networks | and | the | decline | in | collection | ( | ... | ) | Also, | between | 30% | and | 40% | of | the | energy | produced | in | Lebanon | is | wasted, | while | 60% | of | the | power | plants | are | over | 20 | years | old | and | 10% | are | over | 40 | years | of | age; | also | the | 220 | KV | network | transmission | is | not | interconnected; | making | it | an | unstable | network | and | prone | to | problems | in | summer | and | winter. | ( | ... | ) | This | crisis | has | many | economic | and | social | repercussions. | About | 75% | of | Lebanese | companies | consider | electricity | to | be | a | major | obstacle | along | with | competitiveness. | At | the | social | level, | the | average | household | electricity | bill | in | Lebanon | is | estimated | at | more | than | $ | 1,200 | a | year, | more | than | two | thirds | of | which | are | generated | by | private | generators, | which | in | turn | produce | about | 750 | megawatts | of | electricity. | More | than | 40% | of | Lebanese | energy | needs | depend | on | these | generators. | In | addition, | the | electricity | sector | costs | the | State's | treasury | more | than | $ | 1.6 | billion | annually, | or | about | 20% | of | its | total | revenues. | The | cumulative |
