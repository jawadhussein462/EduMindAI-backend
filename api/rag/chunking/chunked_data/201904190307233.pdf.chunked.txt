(4 points) Second subject: All the choices, made by man, begin from an unconscious psychic system. 1- Explain this judgment and state the problematic it raises. (9 points) 2- Discuss this judgment by showing the importance and active role of consciousness in the psychic life. (7 points) 3- Do you think that the argument of the unconscious is an acceptable argument to escape tradition and customs? Justify your answer. (4 points) Third subject: Text Philosophy is not a system of statements; it is not a science. But what is it then? Well, certainly not a science, but nevertheless something so significant and important that it may henceforth, as before, be honored as the Queen of the Sciences. For it is nowhere written that the Queen of the Sciences must itself be a science. The great contemporary turning point is characterized by the fact that we see in philosophy not a system of cognitions, but a system of acts; philosophy is that activity through which the meaning of statements is revealed or determined. By means of philosophy statements are explained, by means of science they are verified. The latter is concerned with the truth of statements, the former with what they actually mean. The content, soul and spirit of science is lodged naturally in what in the last analysis its statements actually mean; the philosophical activity of giving meaning is therefore the Alpha and Omega of all scientific knowledge. 1- Explain this text by Moritz Schlick and state the problematic it raises. (9 points) 2- Discuss the thesis of this text by showing the points of conflict between science and philosophy. (7 points) (4 points) 3- Do you think that philosophy helps man in his daily life? Justify your answer.

It allows him to transcend gradually from the level of these beings and to move away from them. - Knowledge is of multiple sources. We have common knowledge, religious knowledge, philosophical knowledge and scientific knowledge, which is the subject of our discussion. - Scientists agreed that the scientific method followed three steps: observation, hypothesis and experiment, but they differed on which is the most important step. Problematic (2 pts.) - General problem (0.5 pt.): What is the most important step in the experimental method? - Specific problem (1.5 pt.): Can scientific observation be ranked first? Will the scientific hypothesis not have the same importance? Thesis (5 pts.) - Preliminary idea (0.5 pt.): Indeed, this subject deals with the step of the observation in the experimental method, According to the empiricist school of thought, the observation constitutes an indispensable stage for the access to the scientific laws. - Explanation of the judgment (4 pts.): - The observation of the natural event is the first step. - The observation must be quantitative and precise. - Observation can be done with the naked eye, but there is not much left to watch in this way. Scientists are turning to observation by different scientific tools. - The most important observation is that the scientist considers the event as a scientific question to be solved.

- The events to be observed are those that involve a discussion. - Creativity, coherence, language and consistency (0.5 pt.) Second question: Discussion (7 pts.) - Transitional idea (0.5 pt.): However, it is true that observation is very important in the experimental approach, but this scientific step is not enough to reach the scientific laws. - Internal criticism (1 pt.): · If the observation alone was sufficient, we would be able to solve many problems, such as cancer, because the observation allows us to know it without being able to develop a treatment. · All people observe, why do they not all become scientists? The secret lies in the mental capacity to formulate an appropriate hypothesis for what has been observed. - External criticism (3.5 pts.): · The second step must be the hypothesis. · The hypothesis is a preliminary theoretical answer to the question posed by the observation. · The scientist's genius is distinguished by the formulation of his hypothesis, which distinguishes him from his peers and the public. · The scientist does not pose a single hypothesis for the event but several hypotheses; and it is the experiment that allows him to determine the correct one, and sometimes he realizes that all are false. · Hypothesis is a creative intellectual work that creates harmony within science and eliminates the contradiction produced by observation. · Several examples illustrate the importance of the hypothesis, such as Kepler's assumptions about Martian rotation around the Sun, or Torricelli's assumptions about atmospheric pressure. - Synthesis (1.5 pts.): - Despite the importance of the two stages (observation and hypothesis), experiment alone makes it possible to construct a scientific law. It is impossible to speak of the most important step, for the nature of the phenomenon studied is that which determines to the scientist which of the two stages is the most suitable.

In addition to observation, hypothesis, and experimentation, scientific law requires the ability to convert mental interpretations into algebraic equations, that is, into mathematical language. - Creativity, coherence, language and consistency (0.5 pt.) Third question: (4 pts.) - Explanation of the question (1 pt.) - Justification (2.5 pts.): - The candidate could answer this question affirmatively, negatively, or dialectically, provided that the answer is justified. - The candidate will judge freely: · Either he says that over the past two centuries, science has provided humans with everything that makes their life easier, it extends their life and continues to improve their performance .... · Or he recalls that despite all the progress made by science, it has not been able to meet all the needs of the human being. Today we see people dying of poverty and misery or lack of medical drugs to fight incurable diseases ... - Creativity, coherence, language and consistency (0.5 pt.)

Today we see people dying of poverty and misery or lack of medical drugs to fight incurable diseases ... - Creativity, coherence, language and consistency (0.5 pt.) Second subject: First question: (9 pts.) Introduction (2 pts.) - Man is a mysterious being who spends his whole life trying to know himself. - Many philosophers and psychologists have tried to determine the psychic life of man. Traditional psychology regarded man as a rational being endowed with consciousness. - Freud came in the 19th century to contradict this idea and consider that man is the farthest from himself.

Problematic (2 pts.) - General problem (0.5 pt.): What is the reality of our psychic life? - Specific problem (1.5 pt.): Is it entirely based on the unconscious? Or is it based exclusively on consciousness? Thesis (5 pts.) - Preliminary idea (0.5 pt.): Indeed, this judgment follows from the principle of Freud according to which the psychological unconscious predominates over the psychological life of man and thus controls most of the choices and decisions of the latter. - Explanation of the judgment (4 pts.): Freud considers that the psychic apparatus resembles a three-story building: the ID, the Ego, and the Superego. For Freud, sexual need takes precedence over all other needs, and man seeks to ensure his sexual needs from his childhood. - For Freud the unconsciousness dominates the consciousness and speaks at the level of the choices of the man and his decisions ... - Freud presented a series of arguments that demonstrate the importance of the unconscious in psychic life, and explain why its role is decisive, including: lapses, dreams, miss act, results of psychoanalysis ... - Give examples of everyday life ... - Creativity, coherence, language and consistency (0.5 pt.) Second question: Discussion (7 pts.) - Transitional idea (0.5 pt.): However, despite the importance of the Freudian discovery, his theory of the unconscious met with many objections. - Internal criticism (1 pt.): · Freud asserts that everything is repressed in the unconscious and is always sexual, whereas for Adler repression is always related to any anomaly, inferiority, lack, or humiliation. . Sartre addresses Freud with severe criticism. For him, human creation is free. "I exist and I am free are two synonymous and equivalent propositions". - External criticism (3.5 pts.):

· Freud, himself, has recognized the importance of consciousness in the psychological life, without which unconscious does not exist. · Consciousness is what distinguishes man from animal, and allows him to evolve and continue ... · For Sartre, consciousness makes man responsible for his actions. Without it, we sink into insecurity and moral chaos ... · Awareness is the ability to synthesize, make choices, adapt to the world around us ... · For Bergson, consciousness is the intuition that allows man to communicate with what surrounds him. · Cite examples of real life throughout the explanation - Synthesis (1.5 pts.): · The controversy continues between those who give priority, in the determination of psychological life, to consciousness and those who give it to the unconscious. · In the final analysis, we can say that consciousness and the unconscious really exist and that they cooperate to preserve the balance of the personality. - Creativity, coherence, language and consistency (0.5 pt.) Third question: (4 pts.) - Explanation of the question (1 pt.) - Justification (2.5 pts.): - The candidate could answer this question affirmatively, negatively, or dialectically, provided that the answer is justified. - The answer can be: · Affirmative: Man will perhaps have to move away from the traditions and the customs and not to repress his desires in the unconscious as to not suffer from mental illness ... · Negative: Man remains responsible for his actions and must reconcile his conscious and unconscious in order to respect the traditions and customs of his society. -Creativity, coherence, language and consistency (0.5 pt.)

Third subject: First question: (9 pts.) Introduction (2 pts.) - Science and philosophy are two forms of human knowledge. - Science and philosophy are linked and they are merged. - Science has gradually detached itself from philosophy to the point of conquering its autonomy and independence, suggesting that philosophy has become impoverished. - This text poses the relationship between science and philosophy. Problematic (2 pts.) - General problem (0.5 pt.): What is the nature of the relationship between science and philosophy? - Specific problem (1.5 pt.): Can we consider that philosophy is complete with science to improve human life? Or, are they contradictory and they compete? Thesis (5 pts.) - Preliminary idea (0.5 pt.): Indeed, Schlick, in this text, asserts that philosophy is not a science or an opponent, but an important subject that man must continue to appreciate. - Explanation of the text (4 pts.): - Moritz raises his main idea at the beginning of the text, considering that philosophy is the queen of science and that they always need it, hence the need to complement and cooperate together. - The secondary ideas that he cited as strong arguments are summarized as follows: · Philosophy is a system of actions, that is, an activity of deduction and the discovery of meaning; it opens the scientific discourse beyond the real world and adopts a unified vision of all sciences. · Schlick adds that philosophy clarifies and scrutinizes ideas, that it paints an integrated vision of the universe and human goals, while science has the role of verifying these ideas.

· The philosopher stresses that philosophy remains the beginning and the end that frames science and prevents it from slipping into what threatens humanity and makes it uncontrollable, while science tries to explain what is happening in the universe of material phenomena. · Thus, science and philosophy complement each other to contribute to the good of humanity and the service of man, wherever he may be. (The learner will use his skills to explain and enrich the text) Creativity, coherence, language and consistency (0.5 pt.) Second question: Discussion (7 pts.) - Transitional idea (0.5 pt.): However, despite the importance of philosophy in human life and its complementarity with science, we must not lose sight of the fact that science has gone beyond philosophy: - Internal criticism (1 pt.): · How can we justify the tendency of the majority of learners to choose scientific sections? · What did philosophy offer to the sick, poor and needy, apart from theories that do not enrich or secure? - External criticism (3.5 pts.): - There are indeed fundamental differences between science and philosophy: · Difference of object: the subjects of philosophy are universal and general, while the subjects of science are specific ... · Difference of extent: science is partial, it studies a particular aspect of reality; philosophy is totalizing. · Difference of orientation or intention: science is a constructive activity that goes from the subject to the object; philosophy is a reflexive activity that returns from the object to the subject ... · Difference of point of view: science seeks to explain the how of phenomena; philosophy wonders why phenomena are, what the reason of their being is. · Difference of results, difference of method .... - Synthesis (1.5 pt.): · Philosophy continues to have its followers and its role.

· Only the philosopher really opens his eyes to "see" and "foresee" the unknown and threatening future in the chaos of this world dazzled by his science and technique. Creativity, coherence, language and consistency (0.5 pt.) Third question: (4 pts.) - Explanation of the question (1 pt.) - Justification (2.5 pts.): - The candidate could answer this question affirmatively, negatively, or dialectically, provided that the answer is justified. - The answer can be: · Positive: Philosophy helps people solve their everyday problems and understand how to behave with others using logic and argumentation. It also allows the philosopher to have access to critical thinking and to think for oneself; he becomes the master of his decisions. · Negative: Philosophy is just a set of theories and opinions that are constantly struggling.
