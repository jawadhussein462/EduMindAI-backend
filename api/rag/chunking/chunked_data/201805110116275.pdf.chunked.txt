Part 2: Optional Set- Choose 1 of the 2 sets First Choice Set: Analyzing Social Documents (12 pts.) Document 1: Values play a prominent role at the individual and community levels. At the individual level, values are an 'organic' part of the concept of self. Research has also emphasized the close connection between human personality and values, where the personality of the individual can be identified through its value structure, and some researchers consider personality to be the organized value structure of the individual. Values are influenced by the cultural environment of the individual so that their values vary according to the structure of the cultural community. This highlights the role of values at the community level as they contribute to the organization of the social activity of society through its core position at the heart of the community culture. Groups that are similar in value format interact better than those whose values vary within their systematic values. Despite the importance of this subject, we note the absence of studies on individual values in Lebanon. This study is particularly important given the fact that there are several distinct factors in contemporary Lebanese society: The first factor is that Lebanon is a developing country that has been subjected to a climate of global modernity that has contradictions in its economic, social and cultural construction. The second factor that leads to the study of Lebanese values after a 'special' dimension is the Lebanese war which led to rapid and shocking changes targeting the individual and society and changes in the psycho-social structures, whether in the relationship of the individual to society or in relation to itself. المصدر: مجلة العلوم الإجتماعية - العدد الثامن 2003 - د. نجى يحفوفي، د.محمد فاعور - ص 95. Document 2: A- The cultural identity of young people today consists of the overlap of three cultural spaces, the first is the traditional cultural space (from food habits and popular musical styles, and others.) in addition to the manifestations of nostalgia to the past and clinging to historical references.

 relationship of the individual to society or in relation to itself. المصدر: مجلة العلوم الإجتماعية - العدد الثامن 2003 - د. نجى يحفوفي، د.محمد فاعور - ص 95. Document 2: A- The cultural identity of young people today consists of the overlap of three cultural spaces, the first is the traditional cultural space (from food habits and popular musical styles, and others.) in addition to the manifestations of nostalgia to the past and clinging to historical references. And secondly local space, which includes the influence of local media, television programs and daily pension, whereas the third space is the globalized space and the influence of music stars, western fashion, the Internet, fast food, culture of consumption, English language, etc ... The relationship with foreign culture through the channels of globalization is a tense relationship based on attraction and refusal and it is a source of difficulties for young people to build an identity, which generates different forms of self-inferiority. This inferiority is mainly due to their disappointment in political participation and lack of prospects for focusing the foundations of a democratic society in the Arab world, as well as the absence of freedom in public space and the lack of self-realization, in addition to the lack of civic sense in daily life, the persistence of commitment and intolerance and lack of forgiveness, the domination of the family and the absence of the slightest manifestations of individual freedom in private relations. However, they attribute Western culture to what they see as the "social disintegration", "family disintegration", the "dominance of materialism and the culture of consumption". B- The fragmentation of the identity felt by the Lebanese youth is mainly due to differences in the value structure between the prevailing Arab culture and Western culture, especially the separation of religious institutions from the social and political institutions and the culture of human rights, which are essential elements in the building of modern Western societies on the one hand, on the other hand, the victory of values of belonging such as jealousy for the honor of the family or tribe and defending the people of the family which are considered to be established principles in the Arab societies. It is worth noting that the existence of this youth culture requires in many cases the availability of a range of basic resources at the economic, educational and social levels in general, which is not available to large groups of young people who still live under the clan or tribal affiliation, especially rural girls and male urban dwellers, or those driven by the necessities of work or pressures of the social and family environment to enter the 'world of the elderly' and not to continue studying. المصدر: عماد المليتي " ثقافة الشباب العربي: الاوضاع الحالية والرؤى المستقبلية" اجتماع خبراء الإسكوا 2009 . 2

Document 3: Technology is no longer just a technique used by the street, but has a direct impact on the cultural discourse of the Arab societies ... Thus, we note from a linguistic or adaptive point of view the impact of social networking sites and information technology in the linguistic lexicon through the emergence of an exotic language that has become the most widely traded among people ... The relationship between technology and culture is characterized by exchange and interaction. From a historical approach, the mating between technology of the age and cultural discourse has contributed to the expansion of human communication. In the past, universities and institutes have been the focal points for intellectual, social and cultural dialogue among young people, whereas now, virtual social spaces such as Facebook and Twitter have become welcome spaces for information exchange as well as for political struggle and the defense of civil rights and freedoms. المصدر: سميرة الجندلي، التطور اللغوي وتبادل المعلومات في ضوء تكنولوجيا الاتصال الحديثة. مدونة ديجيتال- قطر 2011 Based on the given documents, answer the following questions: 1. a.

Second Choice Set: Studying a social subject (12 pts.) Citizenship is not an end in itself, but a means of social, political and economic participation in society. It is a reciprocal relationship between citizens, women and men, and the state. Active citizenship is achieved by activating the role of men and women to demand their basic rights and entitlements not only the right to vote or participate in political decision-making, but also the right to work and earn a living, to provide health care and education for themselves and their families, preserve personal dignity and, most importantly, the right enshrined in these rights. Active citizenship is a means to expand the range of opportunities available to human beings and to achieve social justice and gender equality. It is based on equality among citizens and on motivating collective action as a means of ensuring equality. What roles should the state, the civil society and civic society play in achieving equality among citizens to reach their social benefits? It is the theme that the project of active citizenship, gender and social benefits aims to understand and discuss. The research, production and dissemination of knowledge were the first strategies adopted by the project on active citizenship, gender and social benefits when it was launched in 2004. The project has carried out research in Lebanon, seeking a map of health and education services and social safety nets, in addition to community researches and analysis of the roles of state and civil society organizations in determining and engendering rights and social entitlements. Research work was pursued in Lebanon with a multi-year qualitative study of sectarian-based organizations and their role and impact in the fields of health and education. The results of this study inspired a second level of research looking into public and civic actions challenging confessionalism in Lebanon in addition of a legal analysis of the position of confessionalism in the Lebanese constitutions. The project on active citizenship, gender and social benefits also publishes the Social Rights Monitor, which includes analysis and coverage of events and information related to social rights, especially the right to health and education to all. Through building alliances and capacities, the project aims to collaborate with sister organizations to develop effective citizenship practice, influencing public social policies.
