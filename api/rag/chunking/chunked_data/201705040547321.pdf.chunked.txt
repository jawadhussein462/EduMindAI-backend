Renewable Energy 1 Energy is the material basis on which human beings rely and carry out economic development. Renewable biomass energy occupies an important position and plays a decisive role in the present world energy structure. According to statistics, one seventh of the total world energy consumption is from biomass. In developing countries, the proportion of biomass in total energy consumption is even more. At present, about 1.5 billion of the world population has biomass as its main energy resource. So, using biomass energy, a kind of potential renewable energy resource, more efficiently is an issue that needs to be seriously considered. 2 Biomass energy is the house of renewable energy resource in the world. Like a great solar chemical industry plant, it spreads in plants all over land and water throughout the world and continuously transfers solar energy into chemical energy stored in the inner part of plants in the form of organic matter. So, a kind of abundant renewable biomass energy is composed. 3 About 120 billion tons of biomass, the energy capacity of which is five times the total present energy consumption in the world, is formed each year by means of photosynthesis. But only one percent of the total energy capacity has been used as energy. It can supply about fourteen percent of total energy consumption in the world. 4 Biomass energy is the only one that has the properties and characteristics of fossil fuel. The sunlight is the original source of both energy forms. Both are formed into original material by photosynthesis combining carbon dioxide and water into plant matter. 5 According to where it is found, biomass energy can be divided into forest biomass, agricultural biomass and aquatic biomass. It can be divided into one-time energy resource and two-time energy resource according to forming process. The former refers to various forests, agricultural crops, grass and aquatic plants that are from photosynthesis and the latter refers to biomass energy that is produced indirectly, including organic wastes, organic waste water, effluent mud as well as other organic wastes formed in industry and agriculture processing. 6 The biomass energy resource has many advantages such as infinite resource capacity, lower price, less sulphur composition, less ash content and the feature of renewability. On the other hand, it also has some unfavorable aspects such as higher water content, lower unit thermal output, large volume, decentralized resource and unsuitability for collection and transportation. 7 The disadvantages of biomass energy can be overcome. As long as suitable measures are adopted; taking into account local conditions, using available science and technology, selecting a reasonable technical program, adopting advanced techniques, developing new energy conversion 1

methods and paying attention to the energy utilization efficiency and economy of biological system, then biomass resources can be used in a more efficient way. 8 A biomass conversion system can bring different benefits to human beings. It has the characteristics of a good all round system. Its waste material can be used as energy and the final residue can be returned to fields as fertilizers, especially the photosynthesis of green plants which can improve the worsening environment resulting from the high emitted carbon dioxide. As an energy source, biomass also benefits to alleviate the contradictions between increasing demand and declining sources of conventional energy. 9 The development of society raises higher and higher requirements for energy. Low-grade fuel is no longer suitable for the civilization. That normal solid biomass fuel is converted to high- grade gas and liquid fuel and then further

As an energy source, biomass also benefits to alleviate the contradictions between increasing demand and declining sources of conventional energy. 9 The development of society raises higher and higher requirements for energy. Low-grade fuel is no longer suitable for the civilization. That normal solid biomass fuel is converted to high- grade gas and liquid fuel and then further transferred to electricity and hydrogen energy which has become the development trend of biomass utilization. 10 Along with the development of modern science and technology, people in the 21st century have a good chance to develop and use, scientifically and reasonably, the biomass energy resource. Looking forward to the future, biomass energy will accompany people towards a more beautiful and developed world.
