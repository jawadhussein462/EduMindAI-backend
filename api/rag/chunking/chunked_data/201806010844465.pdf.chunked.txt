Choose one of two sets- First choice set- Analyzing Documents (12 pts.) Document 1: The Lebanese youth constitute an important group of people at the demographic level, but they bear the burdens of living and unemployment and are considered more vulnerable than others, especially in light of the weakness of the current educational system. However, youth participation in public life is still not required and the potential is due to the absence of a youth policy and its organization, and due to the difficult living conditions, which indicates that the youth's energy is not productive for the benefit of development and social construction. The challenges facing the current generation are great, while young people are cautious about direct political action because of the experience of war. The youth generation faces the challenge of modernity and globalization on the threshold of the 21st century, which is a unique cultural challenge, never faced before by any generation earlier in this way. المصدر: ملامح التنمية البشرية المستدامة في لبنان - برامج الأمم المتحدة الانمائي - 1997 - ص 155-156 (بتصرف) Document 2: Although Lebanese laws treat young people at the age of 18 as adults having legal capacity, so they are held accountable for any breach or failure of their duties and responsibilities.

However, they are deprived of their right to vote, which disrupts the rule of law dealing with the people and the State, which states that everyone has rights and duties. How do to apply to an 18 year old son certain penal laws and is asked for testimony in personal documents and he is prevented from his right in election polls and in voting? Reducing the age of voting will contribute to the development of political and social awareness among young people, who will feel responsible when choosing representatives in the Parliamentary Board ... When young people find no room to participate in expression and change through the legitimate institutions, it is no wonder that his confidence in his institutions will vanish or he turns into a negative citizen, or is seen away not exercising his role in public life and is being indifferent to what is happening, and this would increase the gap between him and his officials and rulers. المصدر: حوار الاجيال، كتاب يصدر عن برنامج شباب لبنان الواحد، الجزء الاول سنة 1997. Document 3: The main factors driving Lebanese youth to emigrate are the lack of employment opportunities due to the size of the public debt and the accompanying rise in unemployment rates. The obsession with the search for freedom has been a magnet for the emigration of a large number of Lebanese because of their lack of a political democratic climate of and their need for modern sciences and the requirements of cultural creativity. Despite some of the positives that accompanied migration in the past, it has now become a serious social crisis, which has grown alarmingly and has threatened the pillars of Lebanese society, which have created a defect in the population pyramid and deprived the country of young forces capable of change. This fact requires addressing the reasons that made young people make a decision to migrate a few months after graduation from university, which led to the emergence of a new category of Lebanese immigrants, including the holders of higher degrees and holders of technical specialization. المصدر: مسعود ضاهر، كيف نحدّ من هجرة المثقفين؟ سنة 2002 (بتصرف) 2

(1 pt.) 7. Find the relationship between documents 1 and 2 on one hand, and document 3 on the other hand. (1 pt.) 8. The documents show the reality of young people and the problems facing them.

(4 pts.) Second choice set- Studying a social subject (12 pts.) Document 1- Studies conducted by the Ministry of Social Affairs and other official bodies showed that 28% of Lebanese are below the poverty line with a total income of less than $650/month. As a result, these families are actually living at about $20/day. However, the expenditure of these families includes housing, food, electricity, water, education and other basic needs. According to studies, the total income of 70 thousand families is less than 300 and 350 dollars. This conclusion does not neglect the need to give priority to tackling this type of poverty, but it should be a substitute for broader and wider treatments that affect hundreds of thousands of Lebanese who suffer from a deficit between spending and income. Despite the codification of balanced development, there are still many deprived areas, especially the governorate of Akkar whose people suffer as a result of the successive policies of governments towards them. What is worse, is the low economic and social reality of the population, which leads children to be part of the labor market and increases the level of ignorance and underdevelopment. The figures show that the inequality index is clearly visible and concentrated in the north, which means the worst manifestations of poverty as a result of inequality. المصدر: جريدة اللواء بقلم عزة الحاج حسن شيباني 13- 10 -2012 Since the emergence of the Care State in Lebanon, it has sought to alleviate the inequalities and achieve social justice, but more than 50 years later, the indicators continue to indicate the aggravation of this crisis and its correlation with poverty and the exacerbation of social problems, forcing the state to reconsider and adopt social policies that would put an end to these problems. Based on the data presented in the document and your acquired knowledge, discuss this issue focusing on the following points: o The concept of the care state and its connection with the concept of development o The social inequalities in Lebanon and its various dimensions 3

o Problems arising from the increase in inequality o 3 appropriate procedures to be adopted. المادة: علم الإجتماع الشهادة: الثانوية العامّة الفرع: الاجتماع والاقتصاد نموذج رقم - 5- المدّة : ثلاث ساعات الهيئة الاكاديمية المشتركة قسم: الاجتماع والاقتصاد المركز الراوي للبحوثِ وَالإنماء اسس التصحيح (تراعي تعليق الدروس والتوصيف المعدل للعام الدراسي 2016- 2017 وحتى صدور المناهج المطوّرة) Obligatory set: Using Concepts and Techniques (8 pts.) 1.
