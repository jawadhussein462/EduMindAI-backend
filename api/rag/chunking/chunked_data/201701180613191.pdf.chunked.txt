Discuss this judgment in the light of other theories. (7 points) 3. Do you think that the scientists, in their quest to achieve profit, ignore the ethical concern? Justify your answer. (4 points) Subject Three: Text We challenged from all sides the right to admit an unconscious psychic life and work scientifically with this hypothesis. We can respond to this that the hypothesis of the unconscious is necessary and legitimate, and we have ample evidence of the existence of the unconscious. It is necessary because the data of consciousness are extremely deficient, both in healthy men and in the patient; it occurs frequently psychic acts, which to be explained, presuppose other acts which themselves do not benefit from the testimony of consciousness. These acts are not only slips and dreams, in healthy humans, but all that is called psychic symptoms and compulsive phenomena in the patient. Our most personal daily experience presents us with ideas that come to us without knowing the origin and results of thought whose development has remained hidden from us. All these conscious acts remain inconsistent and incomprehensible if we persist in pretending that all that is happening to us, as psychic facts, must be perceived only by the consciousness. Freud 1.

�ة الأكاديميّة المشتركة قسم : الفلسفة نموذج رقم -2- المدّة : ساعتان المركز البريدي للنحوثِ وَالإنماء أسس التصحيح (تراعي تعليق الدروس والتوصيف المعدّل للعام الدراسي ٢٠١٦ -٢٠١٧ وحتى صدور المناهج المطوّرة) SubjectOne: First question: (9 points) Introduction (2 points) The role of tendency in man to understanding himself. Distinction between a need, a desire, a motive and instinct. To present the subject, by emphasizing that tendency is caused by a movement or the stopping of a movement. Problematic (2 points) General (0.5 pt.): What is the nature of tendency? Specific (1.5 pts.): Is tendency shown through movements, where every movement expresses a tendency? Or is tendency acquired from a sensory experience? Thesis (5 points) Preliminary idea (0.5 pt.): Talk about the behaviorist theory that explains all human life from its behavior. Explanation of the judgement (4 pts.): Present the behaviorist theory on tendency as a behavior. Explain Ribot's position on tendency that is considered a movement or stopping of a movement. Give examples of how tendency is emerged through a behavior. Creativity and coherence (0.5 pt.) Second question: Discussion (7 points) Transition (0.5 pt.): It would be a mistake to reduce tendency to the movements that translate it. Internal review (1 pt.): Oppose Ribot's theory because a behavior does not always show human tendencies. Repeated movement is never enough to produce a trend. All movements of a living being do not correspond to trends. External Review (3.5 pts.): Present the sensualist conception of Condillac: no tendency is innate. - Emphasize the importance of habits that are acquired, - Explain the importance of the way of life, the family and social environment in the appearance of tendencies. - The chain: lived experience - pleasure - memory of pleasure - repetition .. .. Synthesis (1.5 pt.): The two sensualist and behaviorist thesis have not been able to refute the classical thesis, which explains the tendency as a prime principle, as a force that guides behavior and feeling. Nevertheless, these two theories have had the merit of highlighting the role of affective experience and habit or training in the revelation of the tendency and its fixation to its object. So tendencies are indirectly observable; they are dominated by affectivity and are experienced and felt in behavior. Creativity and coherence (0.5 pts) 2

Third question: Personal opinion (4 points) Explanation of the question (1 pt.) Justification (2.5 pts): The candidate could answer this question affirmatively or negatively or dialectically, provided that he/she justifies his/her answer. -Yes, tendency has increased and multiplied, and became impossible to satisfy. There must be some wisdom in identifying the most important and necessary ... otherwise man will became unhappy and doomed by dissatisfaction. -No, tendency is an essential component of the human personality. How can the artist be happy if he/she did not satisfy his inclination to innovate? Creativity and coherence (0.5 pts) Subject Two: First question: (9 points) Introduction (2 points) A brief history of the development of the scientific spirit (Comte), or a list of the steps of the experimental method (according to Bernard) ... Problematic (2 points) General (0.5 pt.): What phase of the experimental method would be the most important? Specific (1.5 pts.): Is scientific knowledge the result of observation by the senses? Or reason that develops the hypothesis? Thesis (5 points) Preliminary idea (0.5 pt.): The observation for the empiricists is the foundation of the experimental method. The scientist must interpret nature when it speaks and when it is subjected to experience. Explanation of the judgment (4 pts.): The empiricists' current give importance to the sensory experience. -All knowledge comes from the senses. -It is the scientific observation that the scientist has his exploits. -The conditions for good observation .... -Emphasize the importance of this step: a polemic fact, the

Explanation of the judgment (4 pts.): The empiricists' current give importance to the sensory experience. -All knowledge comes from the senses. -It is the scientific observation that the scientist has his exploits. -The conditions for good observation .... -Emphasize the importance of this step: a polemic fact, the role of the mind ... Creativity and coherence (0.5 pt.) Second question: Discussion (7 points) Transition (0.5 pt.): The true discovery, says Claude Bernard, is not that of the new fact, but that of the idea connected with it. Internal review (1 pt.): - The senses are deceptive, nature does not easily deliver its secrets (the late appearance of the sciences is the proof ... ). - If observation could be deposited in the mind as scientific knowledge, how would one explain the very late appearance of the sciences? (A. Comte). - The senses do not give us a spherical Earth, which revolves around the Sun ... External review (3.5 pts): The rationalisticcurrent- idealistic, emphasizes the role and importance of the hypothesis. 3

-It is the intelligence that notes the challenge. It streamlines the enigmatic fact ... and suggests: "Why not"? -This is the genius of the scientist. The senses are common to all, but the hypothesis is a privilege. -The hypothesis establishes the link between the observed matters and the way which judges, confirms, or dismisses the idea. Synthesis (1.5 pt.): It would be desirable to synthesize: the dialectic of the experimental approach guarantees reliable scientific knowledge. -The matter poses the problem, the intelligence proposes an answer, the matter judges this answer. Creativity and coherence (0.5 pt.) Third question: Personal opinion (4 points) Explanation of the question (1 pt.) Justification (2.5 pts): The candidate could answer this question affirmatively or negatively or dialectically, provided that he/she justifies his/her answer -Yes, pride, greed, the race for glory can divert the learned of his mission and push him to ignore moral values. -No, there are laws to prevent such abuse, and put the scientist on the right path. Creativity and coherence (0.5 pt.) Subject three: Text First question: (9 points) Introduction (2 points) With the Cartesian philosophy of Descartes, the notion of the unconscious was nonexistent. Descartes dualism reduces thinking (and thus existence) to consciousness. Thus, to speak of the unconscious becomes a contradiction. In the realm of ethics, the unconscious is, for many, a dangerous idea. If the individual is lucid, rational, and a master of himself, then it is a contradiction to speak of the unconscious. However, it seems that consciousness is not all there is. If I am aware of my actions, it does not mean that I am equally aware of the real motives that make me do what I am doing. Problematic (2 points) General (0.5 pt.): What is the reality of our psychic life? Specific (1.5 pts.): How did Freud prove that the unconscious exists? Is it more important than the conscious in determining our psychic life? Thesis (5 points) Preliminary idea (0.5 pt.): Freud, in this text, proves the existence of the unconscious both in the mentally ill and in the healthy man and the inability of the consciousness to explain certain facts. Explanation of the judgment (4 pts.): The slip is an involuntary error that makes us pronounce one word instead of another. -The unconscious takes advantage of a moment of inattention to slide towards consciousness, in a disguised manner, a desire or an unconfessed need. -Forgetfulness is not either, according to the psychoanalyst, a negative, insignificant phenomenon; it reveals the person, his demands and his worries -The unintentional act is in its turn a conduct full of meaning and revealing of unconscious feelings. The forgetfulness of an appointment expresses an unconscious hostility towards the person we were going to meet 4

The forgetfulness of an appointment expresses an unconscious hostility towards the person we were going to meet 4

-Post-hypnotic suggestion -However, it is the analysis of the patient's dreams at night that opens to us as well as to the psychoanalyst "the high road to the exploration of the unconscious." Creativity and coherence (0.5 pt.) Second question: Discussion (7 points) Transition (0.5 pt.): However, the hypothesis of the unconscious has provided new revolutionary explanations in psychology in dealing with the psychic life; but this does not eliminate the existence and role of consciousness in this regard. Internal review (1 pt.): Sartre: the affirmation of the existence of a psychic unconscious is the best pretext for getting rid of all responsibility ... -Sexuality has been so extensive, to the point that this concept has finally lost its limits; In fact, what is sexual, for example, in a mother's love for her child? -Freud ignored the essential role of consciousness and reduced the whole personality solely to instincts and tendencies. External review (3.5 pts): Certain philosophers like Descartes and Sartre assimilate consciousness to psychic: everything that is psychic is conscious, therefore, everything that is unconscious belongs to the physiological. -It is consciousness that emphasizes human existence. -Sartre (Unconscious doesn't exist) -Descartes (reduced existence to consciousness) -Alain (Unconscious was related to neuro-physiological mechanism like growing of the hair) -Jung's collective unconscious ... -Adler: the engine of psychic life is "the instinct of power" (not "the instinct of enjoyment"). -The superego is, according to Freud, an unconscious instance, how can superego censor? It is therefore necessary for the censoring body to be conscious. -Consciousness is a fundamental psychic reality that is defined by multiple and interdependent functions whose principles are: reflection, intentionality, activity of choice, synthesis activity .... -To the question: how can we study our consciousness? Classical philosophers respond: through introspection. Synthesis (1.5 pt.): - The complexity of the man forbids us to diminish him ... - The opposition pretended by Freud between the conscious and the unconscious, corresponds in reality only to the pathological psychic life, whereas in the normal psychic life the conscious and the unconscious collaborate together in the framework of unity and the adaptation of the personality. Creativity and coherence (0.5 pt.) Third question: Personal opinion (4 points) Explanation of the question (1 pt.) Justification (2.5 pts): The candidate could answer this question affirmatively or negatively or dialectically, provided that he/she justifies his/her answer -Yes, some forms of delinquency, violence ... are due to abnormalities that can be treated (kleptomania,) -No, we cannot ignore the real causes (poverty, drugs, and the culture of violence in a society ... ) and pretend that evil is in a dark unconscious. Creativity and coherence (0.5 pt.) 5
