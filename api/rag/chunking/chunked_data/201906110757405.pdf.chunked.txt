Choose one of the two following Sets: The First-Choice Set: Analyzing Documents (12 points) Doc.1: Culture is a symbolic and realistic system that expresses the identity of the society, with its values and normative frameworks; it differentiates a society from another. Culture has two dimensions; an abstract dimension that is embodied in ideas, ideologies, values and trends; and a realistic dimension embodied in behaviors and practices, which are the products of the first dimension. The individual behaves in compliance to the culture to which he belongs, and which gives meaning and certain significance to his attitudes. Through the definition of Kroeber and Kluckohn, culture consists of models of behavior that are acquired and transmitted by symbols, and constitute the achievements that distinguish human groups; they appear in the form of artifacts and products, while the heart of culture consists of traditional ideas, especially those connected to values. From the above, we say that culture appears in many elements and compounds, including values, which interact with change both inside and outside the society; this change as seen by Parsons, is a sound, continuous and permanent phenomenon in the life of each system, as there is a change in the structure of society due to internal factors and external; this change primarily aims at bringing about an adjustment in human behavior, and values guarantee their continuity through socialization, creating a kind of relative solidarity among members of the same society. المصدر: خديجي مختارية، "القيم، الثقافة، التنشئة الاجتماعية (تأصيل المفهوم والعلاقة في إطار التغيير)"، مجلة جيل العلوم الانسان

 outside the society; this change as seen by Parsons, is a sound, continuous and permanent phenomenon in the life of each system, as there is a change in the structure of society due to internal factors and external; this change primarily aims at bringing about an adjustment in human behavior, and values guarantee their continuity through socialization, creating a kind of relative solidarity among members of the same society. المصدر: خديجي مختارية، "القيم، الثقافة، التنشئة الاجتماعية (تأصيل المفهوم والعلاقة في إطار التغيير)"، مجلة جيل العلوم الانسانية والاجتماعية، العدد ٤٠، مارس ٢٠١٨، ص ٩-٢١. (بتصرف) Doc.2: Since man has been found on the earth, he walks through a fundamental drive, values which determine his relationships with other people; the child may acquire his values from the family, then the school and society. These social institutions face alternatives in raising children and transmitting values, and they have significantly retreated to be replaced by technology devices. Technology has become a reason to escape from direct social relations by claiming to be preoccupied with them. The weakness of these relations and the scarcity of social visits weaken dialogue, exchange of experiences and feelings, and are replaced by short messages. What cannot be understood and worth noting are the high rates of individuals (young and old) who spend their time in front of television or using modern means of communication for long hours, but the current studies show that man is social by nature, and if relations with family members become weak, he finds the alternative in television and other devices of technology. These technical devices have replaced parents and weakened their relationship with their children, due to the longtime of interaction with these devices. Added to this, the psychological diseases have become widely spread in contemporary societies, such as depression, love of isolation and introversion, and the ability to accept the values and norms of the society reduces, and is replaced by the values of the pioneers of the use of technology devices. It is also worth mentioning that the electronic world offers its pioneers, especially the individuals who suffer from isolation and marginalization, a wide range to dispel their fears and anxieties, and to establish false relationships with others, creating a kind of false attraction; this imaginary world becomes a nightmare that threatens and endangers their personal lives. المصدر: عباس سبتي، "التكنولوجيا وضعف العلاقات الاجتماعية في الأسرة ... أسباب ... حلول"، ٢٠١٤/٥/١٥. 2

Doc.3: The relationship between media and values is interrelated and they affect each other. Although media may be reflective of local values, in other cases it contributes to changing values. Judging values that change and others that do not change or that fall within the group's ideology, is related to the degree of cohesion of the elite, the levels of education and culture within society, and the state of cultural and media capital and its attitude towards the values of society. With the spread of globalization, values have emerged as an important element in the internal and external polarization, and it depended on the ability of the local domestic organizations inside the society, to engage positively with this knowledge revolution, and their ability to market their values and develop their discourse in light of the flow of information from abroad. The immunity of communities to foreign influence remained dependent on the awareness of the elite and society institutions to the challenges of introducing new ideas and knowledge; the more they possess the ability to choose from modernization only what suits the community, the more they are able to maintain and develop their culture. المصدر: د.عادل عبد الصادق، "الشبكات الاجتماعية وتغيير القيم المحلية: مخاطر التحول الى اداة للانتقام الشخ
