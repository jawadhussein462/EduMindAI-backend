Amelia Earhart was born in Kansas in 1897. Thirty one years later, she received a phone call that changed her life. She was invited to be the first woman to take a flight across the Atlantic Ocean. The flight took more than 20 hours - about three times longer than it routinely takes today to cross the Atlantic by plane. But she was so thrilled by her first experience in a plane that she quickly began to take flying lessons. She wrote, "As soon as I left the ground, I knew I myself had to fly." 2 After that flight, Earhart became famous on media. She was given a tickertape1 parade down Broadway in New York and even President Coolidge called to congratulate her. Because her impressive career performance and physical appearance were similar to pioneering pilot and American hero Charles Lindbergh, she earned the nickname "Lady Lindy." She wrote a book about her flight across the Atlantic, called 20 Hrs. 40 Min. 3 Earhart was so confident about herself and continued to break records. She polished her skills as a speaker and writer, always supporting women's achievements, especially in aviation2 that she liked most. Her next goal was to achieve a transatlantic crossing alone. In 1927, Charles Lindbergh became the first person to make a nonstop flight across the Atlantic alone. Five years later, Earhart became the first woman to repeat that achievement. Her name even became more popular and that's why she was then called the undoubted queen of the air. 4 Earhart then wanted to fly around the world, and in June 1937, she flew from Miami with Fred Noonan as her navigator. No one knows why she left behind important communication and navigation instruments. Perhaps it was to make room for additional fuel for the long flight. Earhart and Noonan made it to New Guinea in twenty one days and then left for Howland Island, a tiny island in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. The last communication from Earhart and Noonan was on July 2, 1937 with a nearby Coast Guard ship. The United States Navy conducted a massive search for more than two weeks to explain the mysterious circumstances of their disappearance, but no trace of the plane or its passengers was ever found. Many people believe they got lost and simply ran out of fuel and died. 5 Amelia Earhart remains in the Americans' memory as one of the world's most celebrated aviators. She remains a symbol of power, perseverance and adventurous spirit of American women. 1 tickertape: bits of colored paper thrown from windows for public celebration 2 aviation: the business or practice of flying airplanes
