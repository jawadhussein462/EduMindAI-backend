المادة: الفيزياء الشهادة: الثانوية العامّة الفرع: الإقتصاد والإنسانيات نموذج رقم 1 المدّة : ساعة واحدة الهيئة الأكاديميّة المشتركة قسم : العلوم المركز البريدي للبحوثِ وَالإنماء نموذج مسابقة (يراعي تعليق الدروس والتوصيف المعدّل للعام الدراسي 2016-2017 وحتى صدور المناهج المطوّرة) This Test Includes Three Exercises. The Use of A Non-programmable Calculator Is Allowed. Exercise 1 (6 pts) Felix Jump On October 14, 2012, Felix Baumgartner broke the speed of sound reaching a maximum speed of 370 m/s. -V(m/s) Felix climbed to 39000 m in a helium-filled balloon, and then he jumped back towards ground. Felix's entire trip back to earth lasted 9 minutes and 3 seconds. The aim of this exercise is to study the motion of Felix before opening his parachute. This motion is composed of two phases: the first one during the time interval [0 ; 48 s] and the second one during [48 s ; 260 s]. The graph of the adjacent figure shows the variation of the speed of Felix during [0 ; 260 s] as a function of time. Given: Mass of Felix and his equipment: m = 110 kg. 400 370 300 250 200 150 100 50 0 0 50 100 The height of Felix relative to ground is 32155 m at t = 48 s. -48 s 150 200 250 t(s) We suppose that the gravitational acceleration g is constant during the whole journey; g = 10 N/kg. The ground is taken as a reference level for gravitational potential energy. 1) Refer to the text to indicate height from which Felix jumped, and the duration of his whole journey. 2) 2-1) Use the graph to calculate the kinetic energy of Felix at to = 0 and at t = 48 s. 2-2) Determine the gravitational potential energy of the system (Felix ; Earth) at to = 0 and at t = 48 s. 2-3) Deduce the mechanical energy of the system (Felix ; Earth) at to = 0 and at t = 48 s. 3) 3-1) Calculate the variation in the mechanical energy of the system (Felix ; Earth) during the time interval [0 ; 48 s]. 3-2) Deduce the work done by air resistance f during [0 ; 48 s] knowing that AEm = W(f ). 3-3) Deduce whether air resistance is neglected during [0 ; 48 s]. 4) 4.1. Refer to the figure to prove that the mechanical energy of the system (Felix ; Earth) decreases during the time interval [48 s ; 260 s]. 4.2. Indicate the energy transformation that takes place during the time interval [48 s ; 260 s]. 1/2

Exercise 2 (7 pts) Trouble in the thyroid A patient has a trouble in the thyroid. To detect this trouble, the doctor injects the thyroid by 1.5 x 1011 nuclei of the iodine nuclide 1311 This nuclide has a period (half-life) of 8 days and it is a ß emitter. The disintegration of the nuclide 1311, gives rise to a daughter nucleus 2Xe supposed at rest. 1) Define radioactivity. 2) Identify the ß particle. 3) 3-1) Write the equation of the disintegration of 531 nucleus. 3-2) Determine A and Z. 131 4) This disintegration is accompanied by the emission of y-rays. Justify. 5) Calculate the number of the remaining nuclei at the end of 16 days. Deduce the number of the decayed nuclei during this time. 6) 6-1) The energy liberated due to the decay of one nucleus of iodine-131 is E = 1.55376 × 10-13 J. Calculate the energy

Exercice 3 (7 pts) The sun of our solar system Read the following text carefully and then answer the corresponding questions: The sun is a star, a hot ball of glowing gases at the heart of our solar system. Without the sun's intense energy and heat, there would be no life on Earth. The temperature at the sun's core is about 15,600,000 K, while at the sun's surface is about 5,800 K. The mass of the Sun changes slowly over time as Sun converts hydrogen to helium in its core. The Sun orbits the center of the Milky Way at a distance of approximately 24,000 to 26,000 light-years from the center of the galaxy. 1) One of the planets orbiting the sun is mentioned in the text. 1-1) Name this planet and indicate the group to which it belongs; 1-2) Name the other planets in this group. 2) Pick out from the text the statement which shows that: 2-1) Our sun like all other stars does not have a solid surface. 2-2) Fusion reaction takes place in the core of the sun. 2-3) The condition of fusion reaction is satisfied in the sun. 3) A scientist stated in his theory that the sun is immobile and is at the center of the universe. 3-1) Name this scientist and name his theory. 3-2) Pick out from the text a statement that contradicts his statement. 2/2
