(2 points) Study one of the following optional sets: First Optional Set: Analyzing Economic Documents (12 points) Document no.1: What is happening in the region prepares for a new historical stage that is similar in depth and breadth to the events of the early fifties of the last century. Back then, the intellectuals and the main journalists pushed Lebanon economically in the direction of the choice of an open market economy and trade exchange became free and the principle of free movement of capital was adopted ( ... ) The Lebanese pound was also recognized as a currency with an exchange rate that depends on the forces of supply and demand. المصدر: جمعية مصارف لبنان ٢٠١١ Document no.2: ( ... ) It is not shocking or surprising that the events in the region, in addition to the ongoing and deepening political crisis in Lebanon were reflected through a decrease in the economic growth rate from 9% to 8% to 4% from 2008 to 2009 to 2010 and to 2.5% in 2011. It is also not surprising that most economic activities are recording a deceleration or a remarkable decrease over the same period in 2012. ( ... )The decline in the external climate has become a growing concern on the economic and social levels as the excessive Lebanese dependence on the markets of the Middle East and North Africa will lead to a decrease in exports, especially as 70% of the destinations of the Lebanese goods lie in countries experiencing growing political tensions. ( ... ) In this context, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) suggests that the cost of a stagnation on employment may represent a continuous loss of revenues, a decline in life expectancy at birth and a drop in academic achievement. ( ... ) Whatever the reasons, the result is one: youth without work. Beirut, the capital, is considered the most prevalent area where this phenomenon is spread as the population growth rate exceeds the available economic capacity; a fact that leads to the spread of unemployment. المصدر: نفسه 2
