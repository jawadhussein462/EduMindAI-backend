المادة: الكيمياء - اللغة الإنكليزية الشهادة: المتوسطة نموذج رقم: ١ / ٢٠١٩ المدّة: ساعة واحدة الهيئة الأكاديميّة المشتركة قسم: العلوم المركز التربوي للبحوث والإنماء أسس التصحيح : Part of questions Exercise 1 (7 points) Composition and Structural of Formic Acid Expected Answers Mark 1.1 A=Z+N (A= mass number=12, Z=atomic number = 6, N= number of neutrons) So N= 12-6=6 neutrons 1/2 1/2 1.2 In a neutral atom, the number of protons is equal to the number of electrons= 8, so the electronic configuration is K2 L6. 1/4 1/2 2.1 According to the law of conservation of matter, the number of atoms of each element is conserved. 1/2 For carbon: x = 1 1/4 For hydrogen: y =2 1/4 Then the molecular formula of compound CxHyO2 is CH202. 1/4 ii- Greenhouse effect 1/2 3.1 The bond is single covalent bond since the carbon atom shares one pair of electrons with the hydrogen atom. 1/2 3.2 - The number of valence electrons of carbon atom is 4. 1/4 - The number of valence electrons of hydrogen atom is 1. 1/4 The carbon atom shares one pair of electrons with the hydrogen atom and one pair of electrons with one of the two oxygen atoms; it also shares two pairs of electrons with the second oxygen atom. So, carbon has 4 valence electrons. 1/2 The hydrogen atom shares one pair of electrons with carbon atom; so, it has one valence electron. 1/2 3.3 ¿- H The Lewis dot symbol of these atoms are: 2x(1/4) 3.4 :Ö-H 1 H - C = O: 1 Part of questions Exercise 2 (7 points) Identifying the Nature of Electrodes of an Electrochemical Cell Expected Answers Mark 1 Referring to document-2, the electrons move from the copper electrode to electrode (X), this means that metal (X) has lower tendency to lose electrons than copper, and by referring to document-1, the metal (X) is Ag. 1 2.1 The anode is the copper electrode Cu, since the electrons move from copper metal to silver metal. 1/2 1/2 2.2 Ag+ + le" > Ag Cathode half - reaction Cu > Cu2+ + 2e Anode half - reaction 1/2 1/2 1|2

Fractional Distillation. 1/2 2.1 iii- Butane In a straight chain alkane, the boiling point increases as the number of carbon atoms increases. Since the alkane (A) has higher boiling point (0℃) than that of ethane (-87ºC) and lower than that of octane (125℃), the number of carbon atoms of alkane A should be between that of ethane (2) and that of octane (8). So alkane A is butane. 1/2 1 2.2 i- lower than 00℃ For the isomers of an alkane, the boiling point of the branched alkane is lower than that of its corresponding straight chain isomer. 1/4 3/4 3.1 The quantity of SO2 in 2010 is 180 ppb. The quantity of SO2 in 2015 is 20 ppb. So the quantity of SO2 in 2015 is lower than that in 2010. 1/2 1/2 1/2 3.2 - Damages tree roots. - Attacks statues and buildings. 1/2 1/4 4 Addition reaction. Since two hydrogen atoms are added over the double bond to form one saturated compound (alkane). 1/4 3/4 2 | 2
