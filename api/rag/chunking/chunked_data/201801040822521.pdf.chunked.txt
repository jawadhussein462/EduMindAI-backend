| Thesis: | (5 | points) | Preliminary | idea | (0.5 | pt.): | A | broad | philosophical | current | judges | that | language | is | the | concretization | of | a | thought | that | precedes | and | determines | it. | Their | arguments | are | numerous: | Explanation | of | the | text | (4 | pts): | · | The | same | idea | can | be | expressed | in | different | languages, | and | in | different | ways | (ironic, | symbolic, | ... | ). | · | Language | "dresses" | thought. | · | If | you | have | no | idea, | the | expression | will | be | broken. | · | We | happen | to | have | an | idea, | and | to | scrabble | in | search | of | the | expression | that | suits | it. | It | had | pre-existed, | then. | · | A | language | is, | without | ideas, | a | series | of | letters, | or | sounds, | of | no | value. | . | One | can | "create" | a | word: | "chalk | - | plane" | for | example. | Without | an | idea, | a | content, | it | is | nothing. | . | You | can | silence | an | idea, | and | keep | it | for | yourself. | It | will | remain | "naked". | One | can | also | lie, | and | "betray" | the | idea. | It | is | that | thought | precedes | expression. | Otherwise, | communication | would | be | impossible. | · | This | communication | succeeds: | the | message | transmitted | is | itself | received, | because | the | language | is | conventional. | By | common | agreement, | we | mean | by | such | a | word | such | meaning. | Creativity | and | coherence | (0.5 | pt.) | Discussion: | (7 | points) | Transition | (0.5 | pt.): | However, | the | primacy | of | thought | over | language | does | not | imply | in | the | individual | himself | an | anteriority | in | the | chronological | sense | of | the | word, | of | thought | in | relation | to | language. | Internal | review | (1 | pt.): | · | Kant: | "Ideas | without | content | are | empty, | intuitions | without | concepts | are | blind" | (introduction | of | Transcendental | Logic) | · | Thought | exists | only | by | the | concept: | apart | from | the | concept, | there | is | no | thought. | We | can | think | only | through | concepts, | at | least | through | words. | This | is | the | thesis | asserted, | for | example, | by | Hegel: | "We | are | conscious | of | our | determined | and | real | thoughts | only | when | we | give | them | the | objective | form, | that | we | differentiate | them | from | our | interiority | and, | consequently, | An | external | form, | but | a | form | which | also | contains | the | character | of | the | highest | internal | activity. | " | · | Thought | is | necessarily | thought | formed | in | and | by | language, | Merleau-Ponty | defends | the | thesis | according | to | which | thought | and | word | are | made | by | one | another: | "Speech | is | not | the" | sign | of | thought | "It | is | not | a | smoke | announcing | the | fire." | Thought | does | not | exist | outside | the | world, | "thought | is | nothing | interior". | External | review | (3.5 | pts): | Some | philosophers | hold | that | language | precedes | thought. | They | are | not | short | of | arguments: | · | Expression, | when | it | is | precise | and | rich, | is | essential | to | the | reasoning | (in | the | scientific, | or | legal | field | ... | ). | · | By | educating | the | expression, | one | guarantees | a | better | thought, | and | even | more | noble | feelings | (the | titles

| thought | and | word | are | made | by | one | another: | "Speech | is | not | the" | sign | of | thought | "It | is | not | a | smoke | announcing | the | fire." | Thought | does | not | exist | outside | the | world, | "thought | is | nothing | interior". | External | review | (3.5 | pts): | Some | philosophers | hold | that | language | precedes | thought. | They | are | not | short | of | arguments: | · | Expression, | when | it | is | precise | and | rich, | is | essential | to | the | reasoning | (in | the | scientific, | or | legal | field | ... | ). | · | By | educating | the | expression, | one | guarantees | a | better | thought, | and | even | more | noble | feelings | (the | titles | "Your | Honor", | "Master", | a | formal | way | of | addressing | others | .... | ). | · | Psychoanalysis | itself | proves | that | the | expression | precedes | and | permits | awareness. | · | The | study | of | etymological | origin | enriches | thought | · | By | prohibiting | abuses, | or | racist | expressions, | one | purifies | thought | and | ennobles | feelings. | · | When | a | new | concept | is | forged, | the | judgment | takes | advantage | of | it. | · | It | may | be | added | that | language | is | not | only | used | for | communication: | . | It | has | a | national | function: | the | language | that | is | transmitted | to | us | is | the | guardian | of | a | culture, | a | heritage | · | The | repression | of | a | group | (the | Ottomans | imposing | the | Turkish | language) | requires | the | prohibition | of | language. | A | national | identity | is | threatened | (heritage, | emotions, | ideals, | ... | ). | · | Language | therefore | precedes | thought | and | creates | it. |
