Choose one of the following sets: First Optional Set: Analyzing Economic Documents (12 points) Document no.1: In the light of the industrial survey and the statement of those who are in charge of this sector, the problems and difficulties experienced by this sector have been identified, in terms of importance: - The increase in interest rates and difficulties in obtaining long-term loans as well as short-term loans that are often ineffective. - The increase in the electricity cost. - The burden of social insurance contributions on employers in the absence of a modern social protection system. - The relatively elevated custom duties on essential raw materials needed for industrial production and the high cost of exports through ports. - The low technical qualification of labor in industrial institutions. - The increase in the effective value of the exchange rate of the Lebanese Lira and its resulting negative effects on the volume of exports. - The absence of the law of competition in Lebanon and the excessive sovereignty of freedom, where the competition of foreign, regional and international companies with industries that lack proper immunity due to the low customs duties on imports becomes large in the Lebanese market. المصدر: مجلة الدفاع الوطني - ٢٠١٢ Document no.2: The industrial survey of industrialists' opinions revealed a threat of more than 40% of them considering shutting down their institutions in case the current situation persists. Another 20% think of relocating their enterprises outside Lebanon. ( ... ) Signing the European Partnership Agreement (which consists of the freedom of importing and exporting without customs duties) initiated various reactions, and this is understandable in a country that does not suffer from lack of openness but suffers from excessive openness that is not accompanied by measures that promote the status of economic sectors relying on the basis that the State should be concerned with the legislative institutional aspect ( ... ) The business community was divided between optimists and pessimists regarding this agreement. Some also warned that the agreement would turn against Lebanon especially that the technological level is different between both parties. Within this context, the critical Lebanese economic situation emerges as a real obstacle facing the improvement of the competitiveness of the economy and its products; without indulging into the details of this crisis, it suffices to mention the balance of trade deficit and what it represents from channels of foreign exchange outflows and the increase in the marginal propensity to import. In addition, the budget deficit is another negative indicator; as this deficit will forever remain a source for increasing taxes and decreasing growth. Document no.3: المصدر: نفسه The commercial and financial sectors occupied the interface of economic activities in Lebanon and received the largest share of the officials' interest in a way that that no restrictions or impediments to trade were allowed. The optimal approach between the independence of business interests and the non-intervention of the State may have its role in economic prosperity, but in return there has been no serious interest in the requirements of industrial development. ( ... ) Some experts believe that it is necessary to have a developmental industrial model associated with large investments in heavy industries from one side and the ability to produce alternative industries aiming at eliminating imports. This would lead to the development of the industrial sector. المصدر: مركز الدراسات الإقتصادية في غرفة التجارة والصناعة في بيروت وجبل لبنان - ٢٠١٣ 2

Second Optional Set: Addressing an Economic Subject (12 points) Document no.1: The agricultural sector lacks integration with the rest of the economy and suffers from the marginalization of the Lebanese authority ( ... ) The agricultural sector contributes between eight and ten percent to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) The agricultural property in Lebanon is distributed among small and fragmented holdings, medium-sized, while large holdings constitute only 3.55% of the total agricultural area. - The Lebanese agriculture is still based on traditional crops and on varieties of fruit and vegetables that do not suit the tastes of consumers locally and abroad. - The price of imported agricultural inputs is very high (seedlings, seeds, medicines, pesticides, crops, equipment and agricultural machinery) and is subject to the commercial. monopolistic structure, which is very high when compared to the cost of inputs in neighboring countries. - The absence of documented statistics and information on the local market as well as on foreign markets and the international trade movement, which leads to marketing risks. - The lending of commercial banks to this sector does not exceed 1%, which drives farmers to deal with agricultural companies according to high interest loans. - The foreign competition with the Lebanese goods in internal markets, constitutes dumping for this market because of the support that the imported goods receives at the production and export levels and due to the difference between the systems that support the agricultural sector or marginalizes it in Lebanon ....
