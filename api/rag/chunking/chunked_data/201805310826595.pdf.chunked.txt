Management of International Resources 1 Many environmental and natural resources are shared internationally. Examples relating directly to food and agriculture include fisheries in international waters or fish populations, such as tuna, that move from one country's territorial waters to another's and marine mammals, such as whales and seals. In such a case, effective management requires international cooperation. The reason is simple. If countries care only about self-interest, they will ignore the international consequences of their actions. When one country harvests tuna, it ignores the fact that its harvest leaves less for others to harvest. Also, failure on the part of one country to control the importation of pests (animals or insects) may damage the crops of other countries in the region. In all such cases, all countries would be better off if they cooperated with each other. 2 Often, management of international resources affects food and agriculture indirectly. For example, the increases in ultraviolet radiation are expected to harm the growth of marine organisms and reduce both the yields and quality of many crops. Similarly, acid rain emissions affect the productivity of lakes and forests. Global climate change is likely to affect food and agriculture more than any other economic sector although the magnitude of its effects is difficult to estimate. Finally, the experience of Chernobyl nuclear disaster shows that safety in nuclear power is also important to agriculture. 3 These environmental problems are examples of reciprocal externalities in two directions. If one country harvests more tuna, fewer tuna are left in the sea for other countries to harvest, and other countries are likely to respond to this action by raising their own harvest rates. In other words, every country is both the source of the problem and its victim. The reciprocal nature of environmental problems can play an important role in attempts to cooperate in managing the resource more effectively. For example, if all countries that harvest tuna agree to reduce their harvest levels, and one country cheats on the agreement, the others may retaliate by increasing their harvest levels. This serves to avert cheating and hence, to support cooperation. 4 On the other hand, the conservation of biological diversity is an example of a global environmental problem with one directional element. Most of the earth's biological diversity is found in tropical rain forest countries. Some countries have an incentive to conserve some of their biological resources for nationalistic reasons. But they must accept sacrifices if they conserve all of their biological diversity and hence, may be reluctant to do so. Other countries, however, benefit from conservation because of the potential value of biological diversity. The tropical rain 1

forest countries have no incentive to take the well-being of other countries into account when deciding on their conservation programs. The solution may be for countries that benefit from conservation to compensate the tropical rain forest countries for the gradual costs of conservation. 5 Compensation, however, reintroduces a reciprocal externality. If one country compensates a tropical rain forest country for the costs of conservation, many other countries benefit. The country paying the compensation has no incentive to take the full global benefit into account when deciding how much compensation it should pay. The same is true of all the others that benefit from the conservation of biological diversity. Hence, there are incentives for countries to offer too little in the way of compensation. All the countries that benefit from the conservation of biological diversity would be better off if they cooperated in choosing compensation levels. 6 The essential point remains, however, that where countries might be made better off by cooperating in the management of shared resources, strong incentives exist for these countries to obtain benefits at the expense of others. It is important, therefore, to know what can be expected of international agreements that put rules for collective management and how such agreements might be effectively negotiated.

Many countries experience similar health challenges and concerns. Cooperation among countries can support national efforts within countries and across regions. It can be an effective tool for accelerating health development, sharing medical knowledge and making the most out of existing resources and capacities. Write an essay in which you explain the above statement. As you develop your essay, refer to how countries can cooperate on global health issues and how such cooperation positively affects health care worldwide. In your essay, provide a thesis statement in the introduction, a topic sentence in each body paragraph and support the main idea with relevant, specific and adequate details. Give examples drawn from your reading, experience or observation. Your essay should be between 250-300 words with an appropriate title. Revise and proofread your essay. 3

Prompt (B): Read the following viewpoint from a debate on global equality. Sharing resources more equitably at a global level is required because there is a huge disparity between rich and poor nations. However, this concept directly contradicts the perspective of human nature which holds that people are inherently selfish and competitive. Accordingly, having a truly cooperative and sharing world will remain only an idea. Write an argumentative essay in which you argue for or against the above statement. As you develop your essay, support your position by drawing on logical reasoning and experience. In your supporting paragraphs provide relevant, specific, and adequate evidence and examples from your reading, experience or observation.
