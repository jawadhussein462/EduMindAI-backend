The Best Friends 1 The evidence for harmony in the family may not be obvious in some households. But it seems that four out of five teenagers now get on with their parents, which is the opposite of the popularly-held image of sullen teenagers locked in their room after endless family fights. 2 An important new study into teenage attitudes surprisingly reveals that, compared to the past, more than half of thirteen to eighteen-year-olds get on with their brothers and sisters; and one in three has not argued with their parents during the past twelve months. Eighty-five percent of thirteen to eighteen -year-olds agree with the statement "I'm happy with my family life," while a majority said their lives were "happy", "fun" and "carefree". Only one in ten said they definitely did not get on with their parents. 3 "We were surprised by just how teenagers today feel about their families," said one member of the research team. "They're expected to be rebellious and selfish, but actually they have other things on their minds; they want a car and material goods, and they worry about how well school is serving them. There's more productive negotiation and discussion between parents and children, and children often participate in the family decision-making process. They don't want to rock the boat." 4 So, it seems that this generation of parents is much more likely than parents of thirty years ago to treat their children as friends rather than subordinates. There are actual statements to back this up. "My parents are happy to discuss things with me and make compromises," says seventeen-year-old Daniel Lazall. "I always tell them when I'm going out clubbing, or which girl I'm going out with. As long as they know what I'm doing, they're fine with it." 5 Susan Crome, who is now twenty one, agrees. "Looking back on the last ten years, there was a lot of what you could call negotiation or you might call bribery. But as long as I had all my homework done, I could go out on a Saturday night. Yet, I think my grandparents were strict with my parents more often than that. I don't think they were that flexible with their children." However, maybe this positive view of family life should not be unexpected. It is possible that ideas of adolescence, being a difficult time, are not rooted in real facts. A psychologist comments on the surprise that teenagers say they get along well with their parents is because of a brief period in our social history when teenagers were identified as different beings. But that idea of rebelling and breaking away from their parents only occurred during that one time in the 1960s when everyone rebelled. 6 The present generation has grown up in a period of economic growth. As a result, teenagers appear to believe much more in individualism and self-reliance than they did in the past. This has contributed to their confidence in the fairness of life, and thus to a general peace within the family unit. 1
