The Time of Big Change 1 Adolescents can be a puzzle to many. Adolescence is a time in one's life when the brain develops quickly, and the body grows and matures faster than later in life. While adolescents are generally healthy, behavioral and mental health problems, including alcohol and drug misuse, violence and obesity may affect this age group. These health problems can lead to risky or impulsive actions that can limit an adolescent's opportunities later in life. Giving adolescents the chance to build knowledge and skills that promote positive emotional and social experiences allows these young people to avoid negative health outcomes and grow into more productive adults. 2 During adolescence, young people learn how to form safe and healthy relationships with different people such as parents, teachers and romantic partners. Both boys and girls often try on different identities and roles during this time to maintain their psycho-social development. Peers, in particular, play a big role in identity formation. The relationships with caring adults are also important for the adolescents' development. Often, the parent-adolescent relationship is the one relationship that tells how a young person handles other relationships. 3 Moreover, in the lives of adolescents, friendships play a vital role. A circle of caring and supportive friends can help adolescents' transition to adulthood. Parents, teachers and other adult role models can help young people learn how to make good friends. Still, forming and maintaining friendships during adolescence can be challenging. Peer pressure often affects young people and might lead them to make wrong decisions. Adults can set good examples, teach interpersonal skills and help adolescents nurture positive friendships. One important lesson is that friends can say "no" to each other but never break friendship. 4 Unfortunately, adolescents might sometimes develop unhealthy relationships and experience or exhibit bullying or violence. Bullying usually involves an imbalance of power, an intent to hurt and a repetition of this behavior. Many adolescents have experienced bullying, whether they bullied someone else, saw someone being bullied or were bullied by others. Adolescents who bully use their power to control or harm, and those being bullied sometimes feel powerless to defend themselves. Even though bullying is a serious problem, it can be prevented or stopped when those involved know how to address it. 5 Adolescents need to develop important mental health habits -including coping and good judgment- to help them achieve overall well-being and set the stage for positive mental health in adulthood. Although mood swings are common during adolescence, only one in ten adolescents has a diagnosable mental disorder such as depression and/or anxiety disorders. Friends and family 1

can watch for warning signs of mental disorders and urge young people to get help. Effective treatments exist and may involve a combination of psychotherapy and medication. 6 "Resilient" adolescents are those who have managed to cope effectively, even in the face of stress and other difficult circumstances, and are poised to enter adulthood with a good chance of positive mental health. A number of factors promote resilience in adolescents-among them are caring relationships with adults and an easy-going disposition. Adolescents themselves can use a number of strategies, including exercising regularly, to reduce stress and promote resilience. 7 Beside resilience, adolescence is a good time for children and youth to begin taking responsibility for their physical health-from what they eat to keeping fit. In addition to maintaining a healthy diet and being active each day, they should get a

In addition to maintaining a healthy diet and being active each day, they should get a good night's sleep, receive dental checkups twice a year and have a physical checkup once a year. During this phase, adolescents with chronic conditions like asthma, depression, and ADD/ADHD can begin to learn how to manage these conditions. 8 Other than the first years of life, there is no other developmental period during which individuals grow more than during the years of adolescence. These years are the time to form positive habits that will improve adolescents' long-term health and well-being. Expanding knowledge of what reduces all kinds of risks among adolescents to attain positive youth development is as important as engaging a variety of partners and stakeholders who can positively affect the lives and health of teens now and in the future.
