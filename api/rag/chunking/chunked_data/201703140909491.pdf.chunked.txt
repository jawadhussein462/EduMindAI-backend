The use of non-programmable calculators is allowed. Exercise 1 (4 points) Reading an information plate Document 1 shows the information plate of a food steamer. FOOD STEAMER MODEL: 5446 Choose, with justification, the correct answer. 1- The voltage under which the steamer functions normally is: a- alternating b- direct c- both 220 V ~, 50 Hz, 1.1 kW We consider now that the steamer functions normally. 2- The power rating, in Watt, of the steamer is: a- 11 b- 110 c- 1100 DO NOT IMMERSE IN WATER FOR HOUSEHOLD USE ONLY 3- When the steamer is being used, the electric current, in ampere, is: a- 5 b- 242 c- 50 (Doc 1) 4- The best caliber (scale) of the fuse that should be used with this appliance is: a- 1 A b- 6 A c- 10 A Exercise 2 (6 points) A filament lamp A student investigates how the current flowing through a filament lamp changes with the voltage across it. She is given a filament lamp and connecting wires. She decides to use a power supply of adjustable voltage, an ammeter, a voltmeter and a switch. 1- Complete the circuit diagram, started in document 2, to show how she should set up the circuit. 2- The student obtains the following results. Current (A) 0 1 1.4 1.7 1.9 2.1 Voltage (V) 0 3 5 7 9 11 2.1- Plot a graph of voltage as a function of current using the scale: Abscissa: 1 cm +> 0.5 A ; Ordinate: 1 cm +> 2 V 2.2- Does the lamp act as a resistor (ohmic conductor)? 1/2 + (Doc 2)

Exercise 3 (6 points) Overhead projector An overhead projector is a device that displays on a wall or a screen magnified images by shining a light through a sheet with the information or pictures on it. A student of Grade 9 wishes to show his classmates the details of a small object (AB). He uses a converging lens (L) and a screen (E). He places the object (AB) in front of (L) as in document 3 so that its image (A'B') is formed on the screen (E). (L) B Liesegang (E) A F O F 1 cm Doc.3 1 cm 1- Redraw, in a real scale, document 3 on the graph paper. 2- Trace the path of a luminous ray issued from B and passing through the object focus F. 3- Specify on the redrawn figure, with justification, the position of the image B' of B. 4- Draw the image (A'B'). 5- Identify the nature and the size of (A'B'). 6- Has the student set up an optical instrument similar to the overhead projector? Explain. Exercise 4 (4 points) Hydraulic jack F2 A hydraulic jack is used to lift cars. Document 4 shows the principle on which it works. F1 A1 A2 Liquid (Doc 4) Suppose that a downward force of magnitude F1 = 1 N acts on a piston of area A1 = 0.01 m2. The area of the other piston is A2 = 0.5 m2. 1- State Pascal's theorem. 2- Calculate the variation of pressure transmitted through the liquid. 3- Determine the magnitude F2 of the force F2 acting on the other piston due to this variation. 2/2

(a) Alternating. The symbol of the voltage is ~ 1 2. (c) 1100 W. 1.1 kW = 1.1× 1000 =1100 W 1 3. (a) 5 A. I = P/U = 1100/220 = 5 A 1 4. (b) 6 A. It is slightly larger than 5 A. 1 Exercise 2 (6 points) Question Answer Mark 1. A V 21/2 2.1 I (A) 2 2.2 No. The curve is not a straight line passing through the origin. 11/2 Exercise 3 (6 points) Question Answer Mark 1. Redrawing 1/2 2. + (L) (E) B A A F B 11/2 3. Figure. The intersection between the emergent ray and the screen. 1/2 + 1/2 4. Drawing of (A'B'). 1/2 5. Nature: Real. Size: 3 cm 1 6. Yes. The image is real and its size is larger than that of the object. 1/2 + 1 Exercise 4 (4 points) Question Answer Mark 1. Liquids transmit wholly to all points and in all directions any pressure variations they undergo. 1 2. P = F1 /A1 = 1/0.01 = 100 Pa 11/2 3. F2 = P x A2, P is constant because liquid transmits pressure equally in all directions (Pascal's theorem) so F2 = 100 x 0.5 = 50 N. 11/2 1/1
