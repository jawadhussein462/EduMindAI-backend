The use of non-programmable calculators is allowed. Exercise 1 (6 points) Horizontal mechanical oscillator The aim of this exercise is to determine the stiffness k of the spring (R) of a horizontal mechanical oscillator. This oscillator is formed of a particle (S1) of mass M = 400 g and the spring (R) of negligible mass and of stiffness k. The center of mass G of (S1) may move along a horizontal straight axis x'Ox; O is at the equilibrium position of G, the spring being unstretched, as shown in (Doc 1). Neglect any force of friction. (S2) (S1) 11 × X O (Doc 1) 1) Setting the oscillator in motion (S1) is initially at rest and G is at O. To set (S1) in motion, a particle (S2), of mass m = - , is launched towards (S1) along the axis x'Ox. Just before the collision, (S2) was moving with the velocity V2 = V21 (V2= 0.75 m/s). Just after the collision, (S1) and (S2) stick together to form a system (S) of mass Ms and of center of mass G. Thus, (S) acquires the velocity Vo = Voi. 1-1) Specify the physical quantity that remains conserved during this collision. 1-2) Write the equation that expresses the preceding conservation. 1-3) Show that Vo = 0.25 m/s. 2) Energetic study of the un-damped oscillator (S) is set in motion, just after the collision, with the velocity Vo = Vol at the instant to = 0. At an instant t, the position of G is defined by its abscissa x = OG and the algebraic value of its velocity is v = x' = The horizontal plane passing through G is taken as a gravitational potential energy reference. 2-1) Write, at an instant t, the expression of the mechanical energy ME of the system [(S), (R), Earth]. 2-2) Derive the differential equation that describes the motion of G as a function of time. 2-3) We suppose that the time equation of motion of G is written as: X = Xmsin(@ot) (x in m; t in s), where Xm is a positive constant. 2.3.1) Determine the expression of @0. 2.3.2) During the motion of (S), G oscillates between two extreme positions A and B, 20 cm apart.

For this, we perform two experiments. Take: x2 = 10. i A q C 1) 1st experiment B L Consider a series circuit (Doc 2) that consists of an LFG which delivers across its terminals an alternating sinusoidal voltage of effective value U and of adjustable frequency f, a resistor of resistance R, a coil of inductance L and of negligible resistance, a capacitor of capacitance C and an ammeter. LFG D5 R A voltmeter, connected across the terminals of the LFG, reads a constant value of U = 21 V. We give f different values and we register, for each value, the effective current carried by the circuit. We obtain the plotted graph of (Doc 3) giving the variations of I as a function of f. 150 1-1) Specify the name of the physical phenomenon that takes place for f = 200 Hz. 1-2) Indicate then the proper frequency f0 of this circuit. 100 1-3) Deduce the value of R.

(Doc 3) The circuit thus carries an alternating sinusoidal current i. The oscilloscope is connected to display the voltage uAM across the LFG and the voltage UDM across the resistor. (Doc 5) shows the waveforms (1) and (2) corresponding respectively to the voltages uAM and UDM, the frequency of uAM being adjusted to f = 50 Hz. The vertical sensitivity on both channels is 5 V/division. 2-1) Calculate, referring to (Doc 5), the maximum voltage Um across the LFG. 2-2) Determine, referring to (Doc 5), the expression of the voltage upM. 2-3) Deduce the expression of i. 2-4) Determine the expression of the voltage UAB across the terminals of the capacitor. 2-5) Determine the expression of the voltage uBD across the terminals of the coil. 200 300 f (Hz) 400 500 i LFG A Yı q C BY L D Y2 R (Doc 4) M (1) 2-6) Using the relation UAM = UAB + UBD + UDM, at any instant t, and giving t the value zero (t = 0), show that the second relation between L and C is: 10412LC + 15000TCV3 = 1.

Exercise 3 (7 points) Aspect of light 1) In a Young's set up, placed in air, the two slits Si and S2, straight and parallel, have their centers, separated by a distance a = S1S2 = 1 mm. They are illuminated by a source S emitting a monochromatic light of wavelength, in air, A = 625 nm, S being equidistant from S1 and S2. + + The screen of observation (P), parallel to the plane of (S1S2), is at a distance D = 1 m from I, the mid-point of [S1S2]. On (P), we consider a point M in the zone of interference whose position is defined by its abscissa x relative to the point O, the orthogonal projection of I on (P) as shown in (Doc 6). M+ S1 × a I 0 S2 D 1-1) Describe the fringes observed on the screen E. (P) 1-2) Interpret the existence of the fringes. (Doc 6) 1-3) Specify the nature of the fringe whose center is at O. 1-4) Give, in terms of D, a and x, the optical path difference at point M. 1-5) Derive the expression of the abscissa x of the centers of the dark fringes in terms of D, À and a. 1-6) Deduce the inter-fringe distance in terms of 2, D and a. 1-7) Determine the type and order of the fringe whose center is at a distance of 3.75 mm from O. 1-8) A parallel plate, of thickness e and index of refraction n = 1.5, is placed in front of S1.

ME = 1/2 Msv2 + 1/2 kx2 = constant Vt dME The derivative with respect to time gives: " = Msv dv + kx cx = 0 Vt ; we get: dt d2x MSV + x) = 0 Vt; But v is not always nil.

So: 3.75 7 0.600 -= 2.5 rad/s and To = 2π/2.5 ~ 2.51 s). X1= 0.10 sin(2.5t1) = - 0.050 m and V1 = 0.25cos(2.5t1) > 0 => sin(2.5t1) = - 0.50 and cos(2.5t1) > 0=> 2.5t1 = - T/6 or 2.5t1 = 21 -T/6 = 11x/6 The negative value of t1 is rejected; Hence: t1 ~ 2.3 s 1 1/3

Exercise 2 (7 points) Determination of the characteristics of electric components Question Answer Mark 1-1 The circuit is thus the seat of the current resonance phenomenon since the effective current takes a maximum value Io for f = 200 Hz. 1/4 1-2 The proper frequency is then fo = 200 Hz. 1/4 1-3 The maximum value of the effective current is: Io = 140 mA. So: R = 21 = 150 Q. Io 0.140 1/2 1-4 1 1 In this case: fo: = 200 ; LC = 2TVLC 4X12x4x104 LC=0.625×10-6 SI (1) 1/2 2-1 Um = Sv.Y = 4x 5 = 20 V UAM = 20 sin (100xt) 1/2 2-2 The waveform (2), (UDM), leads in phase the waveform (1), (UAM), by |o|. One period (2x) extends over 6 div; the phase difference | q| is relative to 1 div. So: |q| ==== rad and @ = 2nf = 100x rad/s Um2 = Sv. Y = 2 × 5 = 10 V and UDM= 10 sin(100xt + T/3) (UDM in V, tin s) 11/2 2-3 Ohm's law gives: i = UDM = sin(100nt + ") R ; We get: 150 i= - sin(100t +;) = 0.067 sin (100nt +=) ; (i in A, t in s). 1/2 2-4 i = di = C QUAB 1 The voltage across the capacitor is written as: UAB= 1 fi dt= c cos(100x t++ ) , 1500 T C 3 the integration constant being nil since uAB is an alternating sinusoidal voltage. 1/2 2-5 UgD=L di =100 T _100 -T L cos (100xt+) 3 1/2 2-6 UAM =UAB +UBD +UDM Vt 100 1 20 sin (100Tt )=( TL- ) cos (100x t+- )+10sin (100xt+- ) 15 1500TC 3 3 For t = 0 100 1 0=(-TL- 15 cos(=)+10sin (") 1500TTC 3 104T2LC+15000TCV3=1 (2) 1 3 C=1.15×105F=0.115uF The equations (1) and (2) give: L=0.0543H=54.3 mH 1 2/3

Exercise 3 (7 points) Aspect of light Question Answer Mark 1-1 We observe on the screen fringes that are straight, alternately bright and dark, parallel to each other and to the slits, and having the same dimensions. 1/2 1-2 We have the superposition of the two light beams emitted by S1 and S2. When these light beams reach a certain point in phase, we have a constructive interference and this point is the center of a bright fringe; when they reach another point in opposite phase, we have a destructive interference and this point is the center of a dark fringe. 1/2 1-3 The optical path difference at O is written as: 8 = S20-S10 = 0 => 8 = 0. So, O is the center of a bright fringe since the waves received at O are in phase. 3/4 1-4 The optical path difference is written as: 8 = S2M - SIM =3 1/4 1-5 For the centers of the dark fringes, we have: 8 = (k + =) \ and 8 = where k E Z. Thus: x = (k +2) 20 1/2 1-6 The inter-fringe distance is the distance between the centers of two consecutive fringes of the same nature. İ = Xk+1 - Xk = (k + 1 +2) 2D - (k ++) 4D = AD 1 1-7 x = 3.75 mm = 3.75x103 m M is the center of a bright fringe if 8 = k 2, and M is the center of a dark fringe if 8 = (k +2) a, k being an integer number. So: 2 = = 10-3 × 3.75×10-3 / (625×10-9 × 1) =6 So, M is the center of the 6th bright fringe. 1 1-8 ax For the center of the central bright fringe, we have: 8 = 0; We get: -= e (n-1) and i =AD/a, D so: i= 625×10-9 ×1/ 10-3 = 0.625×10-3 m = 0.625 mm. but the abscissa x of the center of the second dark fringe is written as: x = 31/2 = 9.375×10-4 m ax 1.875 × 10-6 m 9.375×10-4 × 10-3 We get: e = D(n-1) 1×(1.5-1) 1 2-1 The width of the slit is: b = 0.10 mm = 1.0x10-4 m; it is very small. The light thus undergoes the diffraction phenomenon. 1/2 2-2 22D 22D L =; SO : L=" 2×625×10-9×1 1250×105m = 12.5 mm b 10-4 1/2 3 The first phenomenon is the phenomenon of light interference and the second is the phenomenon of light diffraction. So, it is the wave aspect of light. 1/2 3/3
