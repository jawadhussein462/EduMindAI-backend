is | increasing | it. | 3 | If | broadly | defined, | trade | facilitation | can | cover | a | wide | range | of | issues, | from | information | technology | capabilities | to | transport | and | other | services. | Yet, | in | spite | of | that, | governments' | administrative | processes | and | regulatory | requirements | remain | a | major | factor | to | be | considered. | In | this | respect, | the | TFA, | which | focuses | on | conforming | and | modernizing | customs | and | taxes | procedures, | will | have | a | great | impact | on | reducing | trade | costs. | 4 | Another | reason | why | the | TFA | is | vital | has | to | do | with | the | current | economic | situation. | The | global | economy | is | still | struggling | to | recover | nearly | seven | years | after | the | global | financial | crisis. | Since | the | limited | improvement | in | 2010, | the | global | trade | has | grown | at | a | rate | substantially | below | its | historical | level. | The | expectations | for | more | growth | in | global | trade | do | not | promise | a | return | to | the | historical | level | anytime | soon. | This | has | provoked | broader | discussion | of | whether | the | trade | slowdown | reflects | a | problem | with | its | structure | rather | than | with | universal | causes; | which | is | a | sign | of | worse | things | to | come. | 5 | The | annual | World | Trade | Report | examined | the | primary | factors | shaping | the | future | of | trade | and | listed | trade | costs | as | one | of | those | shaping | factors. | However, | the | report | makes | it | clear | that | many | factors, | such | as | technological | progress | and | labor | force, | make | changes | in | trade | activities. | These | factors | can | have | impacts | on | trade | flows | that | are | much | greater | than | the | effect | of | trade | cost | changes. | 1 |

| 6 | Based | on | the | World | Trade | Report | estimates | that | trade | costs | might | have | probable | effects | due | to | the | TFA, | it | is | useful | to | add | that | the | fundamental | role | of | trade | costs | in | shaping | the | future | of | world | trade | means | that | any | reduction | to | these | costs | would | activate | the | global | economy | at | present | and | in | the | future. | Accordingly, | the | report | points | out | that | TFA | reduces | the | costs | substantially | and | makes | a | big | upward | movement | to | the | international | trade | and | the | global | economy. | 7 | The | TFA | is | also | valuable | because | it | indicates | an | important | shift | in | the | operations | of | the | trading | system | itself. | The | world | trade | was | dominated | by | the | exchange | of | discrete | products, | whereby | some | countries | reduced | costs | only | when | other | countries | reduced | theirs. | But | the | economic | connections | in | the | global | market | have | been | the | reason | for | expecting | a | different | direction | in | trading | operations. | 8 | One | striking | feature | of | the | WTO's | trade | facilitation | negotiations | was | that | they | were | focused | on | finding | collaborative | solutions | to | common | challenges, | such | as | standardizing | customs | procedures | and | improving | information | exchanges. | There | was | a | broad | agreement | that | countries | would | benefit | by | reforming | their | trade | procedures | individually, | but | they | would | benefit | even | more | by | collectively | taking | these | steps. | This | explains | why | the | trade | facilitation | negotiations, | in | which | every | member | was | involved | in | the | design | of | the | TFA | were | the | most | inclusive | and | efficient. | Questions: | A- | Answer | each | of | the | following | questions | in | 1-2 | sentences | using | your | own | words. | 1- | Based | on | paragraphs | 2, | 3, | and | 4, | why | is | the | TFA | important | for | the | world | trading | system? | (Score:02) | 2- | What | comparison | does | the | writer | make | in | paragraph | 5? | (Score:02) | 3- | How | would | you | best | describe | the | writer's | tone | in | paragraph | 4? | Justify | your | answer. | (Score: | 02) | 4- | Based | on | paragraph | 8, | how | would | you | describe | the | way | the | writer | views | trade | facilitation | negotiations? | Justify | your | answer. | (Score:02) | B- | 1- | What | type | of | introduction | does | the | writer | use? | What | purpose | does | it | serve? | (Score: | 02) | 2- | What | is | the | thematic | relationship | between | paragraphs | 5 | and | 6? | Explain. | (Score: | 02) | 3- | What | two | types | of | audience | might | be | interested | in | reading | this | selection? | State | the | interest | of | each. | (Score: | 02) | 4- | How | does | the | writer | establish | coherence | between | paragraphs | 1 | and | 2? | (Score: | 01) | C- | The | reading | selection | has | eight | paragraphs | (1->8). | Each | of | the | following | extracts | (A | and | B) | is | the | correct | part | that | completes | ONE | paragraph | in | the | selection. | Read | extracts | A | and | B | carefully | and | then | choose | from | paragraphs | (1->8) | the | one | that | correctly | fits | with | each | extract. | (Score: | 02) | Extract | A: | In | a | world | of | interconnected | economic | networks, | where | countries |
