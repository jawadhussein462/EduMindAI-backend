(x-y)(x+y) Vx Vx+y 0.75 3 (a + b)2 = a2 + 2ab + b2 = 52 + 2(12) = 25 + 24 = 49 the answer is (C). 0.75 4 8 = 32% the answer is (C). 25 0.75 Question II 1 % - 1) = ,2 - 2 x + 1 2 A(x) = ( =- 1) - (3 - x)2 = = (x- 3)2 - (x- 3)2 = -- (x-3)2. 0.5 1 2.a F(x) is not defined if x2 - 9 = 0 then x = 3 or x = - 3. 0.5 2.b -8(x-3) F(x)= x+3 1 Question III 1 3(500 000) + 2(750 000) = 3 000 000 and 2(500 000) + 3(750 000) = 3 250 000 1 2 Reduction of 20% on the price of the phone type A then the new price will be 400 000 LL. Reduction of 30% on the price of the phone type B then the new price will be 525 000 LL. Let m be the number of phones type A and n the number of phones type B. (400000m + 525000n = 3300000 By solving the system: m + n = 7 We get m = 3 "type A" and n = 4 "type B" 2 Question IV Note 1.a yc = 0, then, 0 = -= x + 4 so C(3 ; 0). 0.25 1.b Since yB = -= XB + 4 then B is a point of (D). 0.25 2.a CA = CB = 5, so ABC is an isosceles triangle with vertex C. 0.5 2.b ABC is an isosceles triangle with vertex C, so [CH] is perpendicular bisector and H is the midpoint of [AB], then XH = A+B = - 1 and yH = VATYB = 2, so H(-1 ; 2). 1 3.a The equation of the line (CH) is: y = - - x + 2 0.5 3.b The line (CH) intersects the axis y'Oy in L then XL = 0 and yL = - XL +- =- then L(0 ; }). 0.5 4.a The two triangles OLC et CBH are similar: OCL = HCB : [CH) is the bisector of the angle ACB in the isosceles triangle ABC.

5 3 tan OCL = OL = = = 1 then OCL ~ 27° ABC is an isosceles triangle with vertex C then: 2 0CL + 2 ABC = 180º, So ABC = 63°. 1 Question V Note 1 M D H A F B O E (T) (C) (T') 0.5 2 FB FE BE 2 1 According to Thales theorem: FA FD AD 6 3 0.5 3 FB + FA = 8 since FA = 3FB then, 4FB = 8 then FB = 2. 0.5 4 ADF is a right isosceles triangle with vertex A because AD = AF = 6. DÂF = 90° (the line (T) is tangent to the circle (C) at A), then AfD = 45°. 0.5 0.5 5 OBH is right isosceles triangle then HÔB = 45°. ADF is right isosceles triangle (part 4) then AFD = 45°. In the triangle OFI : OÎF = 180° - (OFI + IÔF) = 180º - (AFD + HÔB) = 90°. 0.5 6.a OÎE = 90° and OBE = 90°, so O, I, B and E belong to the same circle (C') of diameter [OE]. 1 6.b OBE is a right isosceles triangle with vertex B therefore by Pythagoras theorem: OE2=OB2+BE2=42 +22=20, OE =215 so the radius is v5 . 0.5 7.a OMB is a right isosceles triangle B (the line (T') is tangent to the circle (C) at B), according to the Pythagoras theorem: OM2=OB2+BM2 =42 +82 =16+64=80, OM=45. 0.5 7.b OM2+OF2=(4/5) +(2/5) =80+20=100 and ME2=102=100 By the converse of Pythagoras theorem OME is a right triangle at O. So EOM = 90° with [OE] is a diameter of the circle (C'), so the line (OM) is tangent to (C') at O. 0.5 Page 4 of 4
