Women's Representation in Leadership Roles 1 Women have increasingly moved toward greater gender equality at home and in the workplace. Changes in gender roles and lifestyles have occurred with men now sharing more in household chores and childrearing. In addition, social rules of etiquette and gender roles are now more flexible and equity within the marital relationship more common. Many women now work outside the home; in the U.S., they comprise forty-six percent of the work force. Although so much has changed, there is much more that has not. 2 One of those areas that have not witnessed change is women's representation in leadership roles. The truth is that women are still underrepresented in leadership roles in corporations, institutions of higher education and the political sector. In the U.S., women now make up twenty three percent of American Chief Executive Officers (CEOs). Few women reach the top in higher education although women increasingly enter the ranks of academia. A total of 453 women, representing only sixteen percent of all presidents, now head U.S. colleges and universities. 3 In studying the difference between men and women and how they lead, scholars face many difficulties. Theories of leadership are typically neutral or absent in their attention to gender as if -a leader is a leader. On the other hand, studies on leadership typically ignore gender differences or mostly study white men. Popular knowledge and women's self-reports often identify distinct leadership styles and characteristics associated with gender while practical studies on gender and leadership often show that the behavior of men and women leaders seems more alike than different when occupying the same leadership positions. Why is it then that the strength of these perceptions persists? 4 We often perceive traits associated with leaders that may not have much to do with effective leadership; these characteristics are often embraced by leaders themselves. Terms like: he looks like a leader; he is presidential; he is charismatic and visionary, are all terms used to define leaders. These often capture what followers want in their leader-which, in turn, is shaped by stereotypical ideas of leadership which reflect socially assigned and conventional gender roles. All of these factors impact the popular understanding of leadership. 5 However, these characteristics of leaders actually have little to do with effectiveness. Given that white males have typically occupied leadership positions, common descriptions of leader 1

effectiveness often favor male characteristics of height, white, and masculinity. Women are also evaluated more negatively compared to men even when performing the same leadership behaviors. 6 Today's higher education is directly influenced by the rapidly changing and diverse global society and faces challenges in how to prepare and educate students today to be the leaders of tomorrow. Higher education can be efficient in shaping perceptions about men and women leadership. It is well positioned to link the local and the global, and this gives it considerable influence over the change process in any society and enhances its potential to contribute to social development and women's leadership. 7 In the end, there are many team players who can effectively redirect the perceptions of leadership towards more gender equality. Hopefully higher education together with the shifting attitudes that the global society is experiencing today can bring about positive change. It is also an achievable goal that women themselves need to persistently pursue. Alice Eagly, author of Sex Differences in Social Behavior, describes the pathway to leadership today for women as no longer a glass ceiling where there is no access; rather it is a maze where it is possible for women to navigate through and find their way. This suggests the emergence of multiple models of leadership, and recognition that a woman leader might do it differently. Navigating the maze will be easier when women examine their strengths and the advantages they bring.
