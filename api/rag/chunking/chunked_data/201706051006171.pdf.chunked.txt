| 4 | Extreme | global | weather | conditions | have | a | disproportionately | negative | impact | on | the | world's | poorest | and | most | vulnerable | people. | It | is | known | that | the | most | vulnerable | population | face | different | levels | of | risk | and | have | different | capacities | to | recover. | A | huge | proportion | of | those | at | risk | are | children, | many | of | whom | are | living | in | low-income | countries. | 5 | Responses | to | natural | disasters | are | limited | to | meeting | the | immediate | physical | survival | needs | of | children, | such | as | actions | of | providing | clean | water, | food, | shelter, | clothing | and | primary | health | care. | While | these | are | essential | for | minimizing | loss | of | life | and | suffering, | particularly | in | the | first | forty-eight | hours | after | a | disaster, | humanitarian | assistance | does | not | necessarily | constitute | or | integrate | child | protection. | Humanitarian | assistance | providers | in | a | natural | disaster | lack | the | knowledge | or | resources | to | ensure | the | long-term | protection | needs | of | children, | such | as | protection | from | harm, | abuse | and | all | forms | of | exploitation, | as | well | as | ensuring | safe | places | for | children | to | rest, | play, | receive | education | and | participate | in | decisions | related | to | their | daily | and | future | lives. | 6 | Programmatic | approaches | differ | among | countries | so | that | organizations | and | field | practitioners | are | left | to | improvise | responses. | Programs, | policies | and | guidelines | for | child | protection | are | complex; | and | despite | explicit | references | to | child | protection | in | the | Convention | on | the | Rights | of | the | Child, | their | implementation | has | been | the | slowest | in | humanitarian | crises. | The | vast | majority | of | 1 |
