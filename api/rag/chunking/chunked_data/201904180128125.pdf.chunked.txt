The use of non-programmable calculators is allowed. Exercise 1 (8 points) Conservation of mechanical energy A simple pendulum (S) consists of an inextensible string, of negligible mass and of length l = 1.0 m, carrying, at one of its ends, a particle (M1) of mass m = 0.10 kg, the other end being fixed, at O, to a fixed support (Doc 1). Let B be the position of (M1) at equilibrium. Neglect any loss in energy and take the horizontal plane passing through B as the reference level for the gravitational potential energy. Take: g = 10 m/s2 = 12 m/s2; cos 0 ~ 1 - - for small angles 0, 0 being in radian. (Doc1) O 0 l 1) The pendulum as an oscillator We give (S), from its equilibrium position, the angular elongation 0m = 10° = 0.175 rad, then we release it without speed at the instant to = 0. At an instant t, the angular elongation of (S) is 0. 1-1) Calculate the mechanical energy of the system [(S), Earth] at the instant to = 0. 1-2) Determine the absolute value of the angular velocity of (M1) at B. 1-3) Derive the differential equation that describes the oscillations of (S). 1-4) Deduce the value To of the proper period of the oscillations of (S). B 1-5) The solution of the differential equation is of the form: 0 = Omcos(@ot + P), (0 in rad and t in s). Determine the value of q and write the expression of 0. 1-6) Determine the position and the linear speed of (M1) at the instant t = To/4. 2) Collision The pendulum (S) is held in equilibrium over a horizontal support AB (Doc 2). Neglect any loss in energy. Another particle (M2), of mass m' = m = 0.10 kg, attached to a spring of un-jointed turns, is placed against (M1), the spring, of stiffness k, having its natural length. We shift the pendulum (S) by an angle of 10° and then we release it without speed at the instant to = 0. When the pendulum passes through the equilibrium position B, (M1) enters in a perfectly elastic collision with (M2), all velocities being carried by the horizontal axis (Bx) (Doc 2). 2-1) Indicate the instant t1 at which the first collision between (M1) and (M2) takes place. 0 (Doc 2) To A B X 2-2) Determine then the algebraic values V1 and V2 of the velocities V1 and V2 of (M1) and (M2), just after the collision. 3) Consecutive elastic collisions 3-1) Express the value of the maximum compression of the spring in terms of m, k and V2. 3-2) Deduce the proper period T'o of the horizontal elastic pendulum knowing that the two particles collide again at B at the instant t2 = >To. 3-3) Deduce the instant t3 at which the third collision will take place. 3-4) What can we conclude? 1/4

Exercise 2 (7 points) Air Humidity Sensor In meteorology, we can measure the relative humidity rate of air, expressed in (%RH), by means of a capacitive sensor constituted by a capacitor whose capacity can vary with humidity. 1) Theoretical study We set up the circuit represented in (Doc 3).

Exercise 2 (7 points) Air Humidity Sensor In meteorology, we can measure the relative humidity rate of air, expressed in (%RH), by means of a capacitive sensor constituted by a capacitor whose capacity can vary with humidity. 1) Theoretical study We set up the circuit represented in (Doc 3). The circuit is formed of an ideal generator of constant voltage E, a resistor of adjustable resistance R, a capacitive sensor represented by a capacitor of variable capacitance C and a switch K. E i B 9 (1) A The capacitor being initially uncharged, the switch K is placed in position (1) at the instant t0 = 0. At an instant t, the voltage across the capacitor is R M (2) C Uc = UBM and the circuit carries a current i. A suitable device records the variation of the voltage uc as a function of time. (Doc 3) 1-1) Derive the differential equation that governs the variation of the voltage uc as a function of time. 1-2) The solution of this differential equation is given by: uc = A + B ett. Determine the expressions of the constants A, B and t in terms of E, R and C. 2) Measure of the humidity rate The capacitance C of the sensor in the circuit varies with the relative humidity rate h of the air according to the graph of (Doc 4). 2-1) Determine the expression of C as a function of h. 2-2) In a first measurement, we find h = h1 = 75 (%RH). 2-2-1) Calculate the value C1 of C. C (pF) 1 pF 1 % 100 2-2-2) The document (Doc 5) shows the variation of uc as a function of time t. The straight line (OT) represents the tangent to the curve uc(t) at the instant t0 = 0. Determine the value R1 of R. 2-3) In a second measurement, we find h = h2 = 50 (%RH), C2 being the capacitance of the sensor. We adjust the value of R so that the time constant t of the circuit keeps the same value as that in the first measurement. R2 is the value of R. 2-3-1) Determine R2. 2-3-2) Draw the expression of the ratio C2/C1 in terms of R1 and R2. 2-3-3) The relation between C and h being linear, so by fixing the value of t (that of (Doc 5)), the humidity rate will be a function of a single variable R; therefore, by adjusting R, we deduce h. 2-3-3-1) Show that: h = 1.3×109-100R 0.4R (R in Q and h in (%RH)). 2-3-3-2) Deduce the value of h for R = 107 Q. h (%RH) (Doc 4) Uc (V) T 1 V 1 ms t (ms) 0 (Doc 5) 2/4

Exercise 3 (61/2 points) Photoelectric effect An experimenter uses a mono-energetic electromagnetic radiation source of adjustable frequency v to illuminate, respectively, three metal plates, one in Zinc (Zn), another one in Beryllium (Be) and a third one in Rubidium (Rb). The experimenter varies the frequency v of the incident radiation and records, for each value of v, the value of the maximum kinetic energy of an electron emitted by each of the three plates in the table (Doc 6). He obtains the graph giving KE = f(v) for each of the three plates, these graphs being represented in (Doc 7).

Exercise 4 (6 points) Chlorine Dating Chlorine possesses several isotopes of which only three exist in the natural state, the 32Cl, the 37Cl and the 36Cl; the first two are stable whereas the chlorine 36 is radioactive with half-life T = 3.08x105 years. In surface waters (seas, lakes), the chlorine 36 is constantly renewed and, as a result, the chlorine content 36, which is generally large, remains constant over time. This finding gives us a reference. In the deep ice, several meters below the surface, the renewal is no longer happening and the proportion of chlorine 36 decreases with time. The ice also contains carbon dioxide bubbles, these dioxides being formed by carbon atoms which are the isotopes 12C (stable) and 14C (radioactive). Once trapped, the carbon dioxides are not renewed, but geologists know that the amount of carbon 14 would be too low to be used in dating, its half-life T' = 5730 years being too short. 1) Radioactive chlorine 99Cl 1-1) Give: 1-1-1) The composition of the chlorine nucleus 36; 1-1-2) The definition of the word "isotope"; 3/4

Let No and N be the numbers of chlorine nuclei 36 present in the sample, respectively at the instants to = 0 and t, À being the radioactive constant of chlorine 36. 2-1) Give the value of the ratio N(t1) for the studied piece of ice.

The system [(M1), (M2)] is mechanically isolated (during the collision) because we neglect all the external forces with respect to those due to the collision. Hence EFex = 0; dP = 0; Pbefore = Pafter ; mV1 = mV] + mV2 ; V1 = V] + V2 ; The three vectors carried by (Bx) are collinear. Algebraically: V1 =V'1+V'2 and V1 = - |VB| (1) (the motion of (M1) is in the negative direction) The collision is elastic: KEbefore = KEafter ; 1/2 mV12 = 1/2 mV'12 + 1/2mV'22 V12 = V'12 + V'2 (2) the resolution of system (1) and (2) gives V'1 = 0 and V'2 = - 0.548 m/s 11/2 1/3

3-1 The mechanical energy of the system [(M2), spring, Earth] is conserved (no loss in energy), between the initial instant just after the collision and the final instant corresponding to the maximum compression.
