at | present | they | are | often | underutilized. | 5 | Several | major | profound | adjustments | and | new | changes | have | appeared | on | the | development | scene. | For | instance, | societies | are | now | more | open | to | debate. | Markets | are | also | open | to | individual | initiative; | privatization | and | entrepreneurship | are | being | encouraged; | and | new | technologies | are | becoming | widely | available. | Besides, | management | of | government | services | is | gradually | being | relocated | closer | to | the | users | in | order | to | cut | costs | and | seek | partners | more | committed | to | effective | implementation. | 6 | Any | development | program | that | regards | people | as | mere | recipients, | rather | than | as | the | actual | generators | of | change | and | progress, | usually | fails. | Consulting | the | people | and | practically | involving | them | in | making | the | decisions | that | will | affect | them | virtually | ensures | the | program's | success. | 7 | In | practical | terms, | effective | planning | must | make | a | deliberate | effort | to | determine | what | people | want | to | do, | what | they | can | do | and | can | continue | to | do | in | a | sustainable | way. | To | find | this | out, | communication | techniques | go | far | beyond | the | simple | question-and-answer | survey. | Meaningful | 1 |
