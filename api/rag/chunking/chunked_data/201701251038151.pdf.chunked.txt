Save the Children 1 For a long time, child abuse has been recorded in literature, art and science in many parts of the world. Reports on children killing, abandonment and other forms of violence against children date back to ancient civilizations. The historical record is also filled with reports on weak and malnourished children cast out by families. For a long time also, there have been groups of professionals who have advocated the protection of children. 2 A greater understanding of risk factors can help professionals working with children and families identify high-risk situations so they can intervene appropriately. Research has uncovered a number of risk factors or attributes commonly associated with maltreatment. Children in families and environments where these factors exist have a higher probability of experiencing maltreatment. However, research has emphasized that while certain factors are usually present among families where maltreatment occurs, this does not mean that the presence of these factors necessarily leads to child abuse. 3 Sociologists have revealed a number of causal factors in child abuse. One is the intergenerational transmission of violence. Parents are likely to abuse their children if they have acquired in their childhood that it is alright to use violence in dealing with child-rearing problems. This learning may emerge from the experience of being abused as children. 4 Actually, research has shown that eighty six percent of child-abusing parents have been abused themselves, while only three percent of non-abusing parents had the same experience in the past. A history of the abuser being abused is only one of the causal influences in child abuse and not its only cause. The other learnt influence - the legitimacy of using violence to deal with problems- also comes from having observed, as children, how parents and other significant adults use violence to express anger or to deal with marital problems. This explains why researchers often find that the child abusers are more likely than non-abusers to have been raised in homes with a great deal of marital conflict and violence. 5 Another contributing factor to child abuse is some social traditions that view harsh physical punishment as a proper way of disciplining children. Many parents resort to physical punishment in an attempt to correct a child's misbehavior. Yet, the problem is that physical punishment like spanking or slapping might spill over into child abuse such as punching or kicking. More specifically, a researcher has found parents who approve of physical punishment are four times more likely to abuse their children than parents who disapprove of such physical discipline. Because of the social approval of physical punishment, child abusers tend to see their abusive 1

behavior as good and proper. This can be illustrated by the case of a father who had severely beaten his two boys: one five years old and the other only eighteen months old. In the hospital where the boys were brought in for treatment of multiple bruises and fractures, the father said to the examining physician that children have to be taught obedience and respect for authority. 6 Prevention is the best hope for reducing child abuse and improving the lives of children and families. Preventing child abuse requires a shared commitment and perpetual efforts of individuals and organizations to strengthen families in every community. Much more can be done about the problem. In many countries, there is little recognition of child abuse among the public or health professionals. Recognition and awareness, although essential elements for effective prevention, are only part of the solution. Yet, prevention efforts and policies are real opportunities for helping children

Yet, prevention efforts and policies are real opportunities for helping children, their caregivers and the environments in which they live in order to prevent potential abuse from occurring and to deal effectively with cases of abuse that have taken place.
