Young Migrants Tell Their Stories 1 In 2010, there were twenty-seven million international migrants aged fifteen to twenty-four in the world and when migrants aged twenty-five to thirty-four are included, young migrants make up almost one third of all international migrants, according to the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affair (UNDESA). 2 A newly launched World Youth Report on Youth & Migration produced by UNDESA attempted to explore the effects of the current situation of young migrants through their own personal stories. The report was marked during a special event at UN headquarters in New York featuring inspiring performances by young poets, musicians, actors and dancers. 3 In line with the report's goal to study youth migration through the stories of young migrants themselves and how migration has personally affected them, the research was based on a variety of participatory activities with young migrants such as e-consultation process, a survey on youth migration and development, and designing visual artwork depicting the daily life of young migrants. 4 "The literature on youth migration and its development impact in countries of origin and destination is sparse. This report attempts to fill in this gap and offers a comprehensive account of the life experiences of young migrants," says the report. 5 According to the report, misconceptions surrounding migrants can result in dramatic impacts such as stereotyping, anti-migrant discrimination and violence, xenophobia, social exclusion and the abuse of migrants' human rights. This can also interfere with their social and economic integration and limit their opportunities to benefit from development. 6 The experiences of young migrants indicate the harsh conditions they lived in their migration experiences. One migrant felt abused by people in his own community and another was unable to find affordable housing. Another personal story includes a woman whose skin color and her community's inability to protect her rights within this context were central to her migration decision. 7 However, some of the stories shed a positive light. The report includes the story of a young man who says that he is grateful to his ability to migrate because he was able to escape his life as a child porter of heavy baggage. Another young migrant will return home to use his medical training in his own community. 8 While some may be enthusiastic about the prospect of moving abroad, the process of migration itself is often a challenge. Young people report difficulties in receiving accurate information about their destination and complications in terms of obtaining the necessary documents. Young migrants also find themselves lacking an appropriate support system in their 1

destination. To improve the process and protect young people from human rights abuses, youth participating in online consultations recommend the implementation of awareness-raising campaigns, pre-departure orientation programs and peer-to-peer initiatives. 9 Among many other reasons, employment and education were the dominant reasons why many young people make the initial decision to migrate. According to the report, migration may be voluntary or forced. It is important to realize though that in the complex realities of contemporary migration, the lines between wholly forced and wholly voluntary migration are increasingly blurred. 10 Many young migrants are forced to migrate, for such diverse reasons as to escape conflict or persecution, or because of poverty, discrimination, natural disasters, and violence. On their journeys, many will experience a range of human rights abuses including human trafficking, abusive smugglers, dangerous border control operations such as interceptions and push backs, and violence at international borders. 11 While migration outcomes vary, young people have said that the migration experience can be rewarding and has positively changed them. When young student migrants from developing countries return home, they proudly feel their new skills will have a positive developmental impact on the future of their countries of origin and communities.
