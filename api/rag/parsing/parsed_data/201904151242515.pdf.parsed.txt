Co 15.75 Set-3 is the most precise one since we need: - a 10 mL graduated pipette is required to withdraw Vo. - a 100 mL volumetric flask to prepare Vf. 2.1 Att = 233s we have: VCO2(1=233) 240×10-3 nc02(t=233) =10×10-3 mol Vm 24 0.5 2.2 n CO2 x 10-3 mol 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 1 3 2 1 t (s) 0 0 60 t1/2 120 180 240 300 360 420 2.3 n (CH3COOH)o= C x V = 1 x 0.06 = 0.06 mol. i M 84 1.25 n(NaHCO 3 ) initial =0.015mol=n 'HCO3 1 0.06 0.015 Ratio: RCH3COOH = 0.06>R =0.015 1 `HCO3 1 HCO3" is the limiting reactant. 2.4.1 True.

n acid ( present in the sample) = n 'HO" (added in VbE) . 1 1 nacid =Cp xVBE= 0.4x7.5x10-3 =0.003mol 2.6 m acid = n x M = 0.003 x 88 = 0.264 g 0.5 2.7 0.264 % by mass of butyricacid = x100=3.3% <4% 8 0.5 Thus the analyzed butter is not rancid. Part of question Exercise 3 (6 points) Fruity Odor Esters Expected Answer Mark 1.1 (B) gives a positive test with 2,4-DNPH then the compound (B) is a carbonyl compound (aldehyde or ketone) and a negative test with Schiff's reagent then (B) is a ketone. 0.5 1.2 Since (B) is ketone; (A) is a secondary alcohol. 1.3.1 According to the law of proportions: 12n M 12n 14n+18 = A then = % C 100 60 100 n = 3 hence the molecular formula of (A) is C3H8O. 0.75 1.3.2 (A): CH3 - CHOH - CH3 (B) : CH3 - CO - CH3. 0.5 2.1 b. CH3 - COOH. The molecular formula (C5H10O2) of the ester (E1) satisfies the general formula of an open chain saturated ester. The ester (E1) is formed of 5 carbon atoms (C5H10O2) and the alcohol (A) is formed of 3 carbon atoms (C3H8O). It remains for the carboxylic acid 5 - 3 = 2 carbons. 0.75 2.2 (E1) : CH3 - COO - CH - CH3 1-methylethyl ethanoate. CH3 0.5 2.3 (E2) : CH3 - CH - COO - CH2 - CH3 CH3 0.5 3.1 - Reflux heating under reflux increases the rate of the reaction. - The reflux is preventing to lose the components of the reaction by condensing their vapors escaping and returning them to the reactional mixture. To conserve the mass of reactants and products during heating. 0.5 3.2.1 In order to synthesize E1 and E2, The initial mixture of reactants is equimolar then no excess reactant. - For the ester (E1), the alcohol used is a secondary then the yield of this synthesis must be 60%. Thus nacid = nester(theoretical) = 0.1 mol. nester(experimental) = yield x nester(theoretical) = 0.6 x 0.1 = 0.06 mol. - For the ester (E2), the alcohol used is a primary then the yield of this synthesis must be 66%. Thus nacid = nester(theoretical) = 0.1 mol and nester(experimental) = yield x nester(theoretical) = 0.66 x 0.1 = 0.066 mol. 1 3.2.2 If the carboxylic acid used in the preparation of ester is replaced by its acid anhydride derivative, the esterification reaction will be complete and faster, and then the yield increases. 0.5 3.2.3 Concentrated sulfuric acid in small amounts acts as a catalyst that accelerates the rate of the reaction without affecting the yield. 0.5 3 /3
