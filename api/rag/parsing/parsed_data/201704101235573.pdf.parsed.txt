Exercise 3 (6 points) Sulfur Dioxide Pollution Part of questions Expected answers Mark 1.1 To choose one of the harmful effects caused by acid rain: - The impoverishment of the natural environment. or - The deterioration of the buildings. 1/2 1.2 The major source of sulfur dioxide production is (coal, oil, gas oil) 1/2 1.3 This gas is irritating to the respiratory system. 1/2 2.1 The amount of sulfur dioxide, released into the air on 1975 is: 130,000 Gg The amount of sulfur dioxide, released into the air on 2000 is: 105,000 Gg. 1/2 1/2 2.2 The quantity of sulfur dioxide released decreases from 1975 to 2000, so, the air pollution caused by the release of SO2 decreased during that period. 1 3.1 Let x be the o.n of S in SO2 therefore x-4 = 0 Therefore the o.n of sulfur in SO2 is +IV 1/2 3.2 o.n: 0 0 +IV -II S(s) + O2(g) -> SO2(g) The oxidation number of sulfur increases from 0 in (S) to + IV in SO2. It's an oxidation. On the other hand, the oxidation number of oxygen decreases from 0 in O2 to -II in SO2. It's a reduction. Since there is a change in oxidation number: Then this reaction is redox. 1 1/2 3.3 The oxidizing agent is O2 since its oxidation number decreases. 1/2 3/3
