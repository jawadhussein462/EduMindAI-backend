The unemployment is mainly affecting fresh graduates from universities, pushes them to emigrate in high rates to the gulf countries and at lower rates to other countries, in addition, unemployment is more prevalent in the city than in the countryside, this is mainly due to the low level of wages that aren't enough for city's residents. Unemployment also rises with the high level of education, as the holder of the certificate does not accept a job that does not fit his scientific level. The current reasons of high unemployment in Lebanon are due to the dismissal of workers from gulf countries, the critical global economic situation, the increase wages in public and private sectors, the increase in the percentage of graduates from universities and the deterioration of the economic situation in addition to the absence of an official plan to accommodate the incomings from abroad. The best solution of unemployment in Lebanon is to stimulate growth by strengthening the national economic situation to be able to create job opportunity. Source: http://www.saidaonline.com/news.
