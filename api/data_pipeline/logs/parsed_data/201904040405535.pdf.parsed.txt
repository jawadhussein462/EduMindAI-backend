Exercise 2 (5 points) A LED lamp replacing an incandescent light bulb The aim of this exercise is to show evidence of the importance of the replacement of an incandescent light bulb by a LED lamp, both producing the same luminosity (Doc. 1). LED lamp Incandescent light bulb (Doc. 1) Consider the two lamps (A) and (B). (A) is an incandescent light bulb carrying the indications (220 V, 100 W) and (B) is a LED lamp carrying the indications (220 V, 25 W). The two lamps are considered as resistors functioning for the same duration of 5 hours per day. 1) Justify that the two lamps function normally when they are connected across the mains in Lebanon. 2) Calculate, in kWh, the electric energy consumed by the lamp (A) for 5 hours. 3) Show that the monthly consumption of the lamp (A) is 15 kWh. 4) The average cost of each kWh is 200 LP. Deduce the monthly cost due to the use of the lamp (A). 5) The monthly cost of the electric energy consumed by lamp (B) for the same duration is 750 LP. Conclude while comparing the monthly cost of each lamp. 1/2

Exercise 3 (6 points) Converging lens Consider a converging lens (L) of focal length f and a luminous object (AB) of size AB = 5 cm. (AB) is placed at a distance OA = 15 cm from (L), perpendicularly to its optical axis at A. The image (A'B') of (AB), given by (L), is received on a screen placed at a distance OA'= 30 cm from (L).

Consider a rectangular block of mass 0.24 kg and of dimensions 2 cm, 4 cm and 8 cm as shown in (Doc. 4). Given: g = 10 N/kg; density of water p = 1000 kg/m3. 1) Calculate the magnitude of the weight of the block. 2) Show that the volume of the block is V = 64×10-6 m3. 3) An object floats on the surface of water when its density is smaller than that of water. Specify whether this block can float on the surface of water or sink to the bottom. 8 cm (Doc. 4) 2/2 2 cr 4 cm

The resistance Req of the resistor equivalent to 2 resistors of resistances 1 R1 and R2 connected in parallel is: 1 1 + Req R2 1 2 True. 1 3 False. When a liquid is at rest, the pressure is the same at any point on the same horizontal level within this liquid. 1 4 False. When a body, subjected to two forces, is at equilibrium, these two forces have the same line of action, the same magnitude and opposite directions. 1 5 True. 1 Exercise 2 (5 points) A LED lamp replacing an incandescent light bulb Question Answer Mark 1 The two lamps have rated voltage of 220 V, which is equal to the effective value of the voltage of the mains in Lebanon. 1 2 E(kWh)= P(kw) × At(h) =0.1x5=0.5 kWh. 1 3 Monthly consumption = (0.5 x 30) = 15 kWh. 1 4 Monthly cost = 15 x 200 = 3000 LP. 1 5 Monthly cost (Lamp (A)) = 3000 LP Monthly cost (Lamp (B)) = 750 LP. It's better to use the LED lamp because it is more economical. 1 Exercise 3 (6 points) Converging lens Question Answer Mark 1.1 Figure reproduction: 1 (L) (Screen) B X A O 5 cm 5 cm 1/2
