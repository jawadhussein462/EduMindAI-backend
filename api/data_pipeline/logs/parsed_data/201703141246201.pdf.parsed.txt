The use of non-programmable calculators is allowed. Exercise 1 (61/2 points) Young's slits Consider the Young's slits device (Doc 1) made up of two very thin and horizontal slits S1 and S2 separated by a distance a = 1 mm, a screen (E) parallel to the plane containing S1 and S2 and a monochromatic light source S. The screen (E) is at a distance D = 2 m from the midpoint I of [S1S2]. The light source (S) is on the perpendicular bisector of [S1S2]. This bisector meets the screen (E) at a point O. The wavelength in air of the monochromatic light is 2 = 650 nm. S (E) (P) M Sı I 0 (Doc 1) S2 1) A pattern is observed on the screen (E). Indicate the name of the correspondent phenomenon. 2) State the conditions ensured by S1 and S2 in order to obtain this pattern. 3) Consider a point M of the pattern observed on the screen (E) such as OM = x . Take di = SIM and d2 = S2M. Write the relation that gives the optical path difference 8 = d2 - d1 at M in terms of a, D and x. 4) Define the interfringe distance i. 5) The point O coincides with the centre of a fringe called central fringe.

Specify whether this fringe is bright or dark. 8) S is at a distance d = 10 cm from I. We displace S vertically of a distance y = 1 cm to the side of S1. The new optical path difference is then: 8'= +9. Specify the direction of the displacement of the centre of the central fringe (to the side of S1 or S2) and calculate the displacement.

This puck, of centre of mass G, may slide without friction on a horizontal rail (Doc 4). The document (Doc 4) shows a horizontal axis Ox of origin O. At equilibrium, G coincides with O.
