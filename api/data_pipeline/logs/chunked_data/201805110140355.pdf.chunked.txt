Choose 1 of the following sets: The first optional set: Analysis of social documents. (12 pts.) Document 1: Year Situation 2002 2004 2007 Illiteracy 13.6% Enrollment 93.4% 92.8% Failure 14.5% - 15.5% 15.4% Dropping out from school (From Grade 4) 7.1%-7.4% التقرير الاقتصادي العربي الموحد - جامعة الدول العربية - 2009 :Source Document 2: The middle class feels that their purchasing power has diminished, and therefore it has been affected by poverty. This is due to several reasons, the most important of which is the increase in the prices of basic commodities, in addition to the fact that the Lebanese state has not developed through their successive governments any plan to improve the standard of living. However, between yesterday and today, the middle class has shrunk to half its size, although by all accounts it has leveraged democracy, leading to poor living conditions. In light of the lack of accurate studies in this regard, it is necessary to recall the 'obvious' link between the deterioration of the political and economic situation and the increase in migration, especially among the middle-income groups where Lebanon lost 40% of the labor force between 2000 and 2003, and it is the highest rate in the region. Thus, the demand to raise wages, whatever the increase in it, it is not the magic solution, and the middle class, and one of the members of his family serious illness or chronic and expensive, will quickly deteriorate into poverty > ... But, the state's most effective solution is a 'different safety net, committed to renewing the social contract between the state and the citizen, through tax and service reforms that raise the standard of living, with a fiscal policy that controls inflation rather than serving the public debt'. (بتصرف) -وفاء عبدالله - بيروت 26-5- 2012 Source: http://www.albayan.ae/one Document 3: The circulation of human thought over the course of modern times has been the value and importance of equality, and people have dreamed of social justice. This was introduced in their doctrines, and then in their philosophies and religious, moral and legal systems. Equality and justice are far from reality and from people. But contemporary social science puts our hands on a tangible meaning of justice and a true indicator of equality: Equality is the integration of people in their society at different levels: At the professional and production levels, income and consumption, political action and social interaction. Inequality is the exclusion or marginalization of such participation. It is contrary to the principle of equal opportunity in at least two respects: The first is that exclusion leads to unequal educational and professional opportunities; and second, exclusion is a denial of equal opportunities at the level of political participation. المصدر: الاستبعاد الاجتماعي-محاولة للفهم-عالم المعرفة -تشرين الثاني- الكويت 2007.

The second optional set: Studying a social subject. (12 pts.) Document 1: The effects of inequalities in access, resources and opportunities among different segments of the population will have serious implications for the long-term prosperity of the country and the ability of people to realize their full potential. As experience has shown around the world, inequality of opportunity is expected to capture people in cycles of poverty that are often beyond generations. Economic, social and political inequalities are rooted in unequal social and cultural institutions that do not depend on parity. The social networks that the poor can access are far different from those available to the rich. Such networks are closely aligned with the cultural values that bind members of society to one another. The traps of inequality affect not only distribution but the dynamics of growth and development as a whole. On the long term, this may mean that equality and justice are complementary and complement each other (not replacing one another). The negative impact created by inequality is not limited to the welfare of socio-economic citizens, but also to the essence idea of citizenship. Democratic citizenship includes not only political and civil rights, but also social rights. The people's understanding of these rights and the fulfillment of their duties as citizens are at the core of defining themselves as citizens with a certain national identity المصدر: برنامج الأمم المتحدة الإنمائي 2008 ص.66 Document 2: Article 25: Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, including nutrition, clothing, housing, medical care and social services, and the right to livelihood in cases of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age and other loss of livelihood as a result of extraneous circumstances of his will. المصدر: الاعلان العالمي لحقوق الانسان. Despite the reforms adopted by the Lebanese state to achieve the concept of a state of care and the implementation of the Human Rights Charter, inequality is still a phenomenon and a major cause of social conflict.

The effect of inequality on social mobility based on the theory of Bourdieu . The reflection of inequality on the process of social integration .
