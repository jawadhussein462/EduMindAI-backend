Urban Population 1 Towns and cities in the world's developing countries are growing on an unprecedented scale. Ten years ago, an estimated 40% percent of the developing world's population (2 billion) lived in urban areas. Since then, their numbers have expanded twice as fast as total population growth to more than 2.5 billion. That is the equivalent to the emergence of five new cities the size of Beijing every twelve months. By 2025, more than half the developing world's population (3.5 billion) will be urban. 2 Urbanization in Europe and North America took centuries, and it is urged by industrialization and steady increase in per capita income while in the developing world, it will occur in the space of two or three generations. In many developing countries, urban growth is driven not by economic opportunity but by high birth rates and a mass influx of rural people seeking to escape hunger, poverty and insecurity. 3 Most of the world's fastest growing cities are found in low-income countries of Asia and Africa with young populations. Over the next ten years, the current number of urban dwellers in Sub-Saharan Africa is expected to grow by almost 45%, from 320 million to 460 million. 4 Urbanization in low-income countries is accompanied by high levels of poverty, unemployment and food insecurity. Worldwide, an estimated one billion people live in crowded slums without access to basic health, water and sanitation services. Around 30% of the developing world's urban population are unemployed or "working poor" with incomes below poverty lines. 5 Those urban poor spend most of their income just to feed themselves. Yet, their children suffer from levels of malnutrition that are often as high as those found in rural areas. Millions of poor slum dwellers live in deprived and overcrowded areas in the city with no enough food. 6 The growth of urban slums in the cities outpaces urban growth by a wide margin. It is expected that the proportion of the urban population living in poverty could reach higher percentages later. For example, within a few years, 85% of poor people in Latin America and almost half of those in Africa and Asia will be concentrated in cities. 7 This prospect has been described as "the new population bomb" and a nightmare for the government as cities will be degraded and impoverished with large vulnerable populations that are socially excluded, young and unemployed. 8 However, a brighter future for the world's developing cities is both imperative and possible. Historically, cities have been places not of misery and despair but of opportunity for better economy, 1

employment and improved living standards; especially for rural people seeking a better life. They have been as engines of national economic development. 9 Designing the conditions to realize the potential of growing cities across the developing world is crucial now and will be more so in the decades ahead. The challenge is to steer urbanization from its current weak path towards sustainable green cities that offer their inhabitants choice, opportunity and hope. 10 The concept of "green cities" - designed for self-reliance and social, economic and environmental sustainability - is usually linked with urban planning in more developed countries. It suggests high-tech environment friendly planning of buildings, bicycle greenways, and zero-waste. 11 However, it has a special application and different social and economic aspects in low-income developing countries. There, the core principles of green cities can guide urban development that ensures food security, decent income, a clean environment and good administration for all citizens. 12 A starting point for growing greener cities is to recognize and integrate into urban policy and planning many of the innovative solutions that the urban poor themselves have developed to strengthen their communities and improve their lives. In that way, urbanization can be sustained since it builds upon and improves the lifestyles that the population has grown accustomed to.

However, urbanization in developing countries is prompted demographically by high birth rate and mass influx from rural areas caused by poverty, hunger and insecurity. 3- The writer refers to the threat of cities turning into poor areas with higher percentages of urban population living in poverty. 4- The writer suggests that urban policy and planning should include the innovative ways that the poor living in urban areas have adopted to improve their lives. 5- a) "those" in paragraph 5 refers to levels of malnutrition. a) "They" in paragraph 8 refers to cities. b) "it" in paragraph 11 refers to the concept of "green cities". c) "There" in paragraph 11 refers to low-income developing countries. B- 1- The writer uses startling statistics that show the high rate of population growth in the world's developing countries. It serves to orient the readers to the issue of the fast growth of population. 2- The writer uses the simile "as engines" to compare cities to engines. This simile aims to show that cities continuously produce opportunities for social progress and economic growth. 3- The thematic relationship between paragraphs 10 and 11 is a contrast relationship. In paragraph 10, the writer states that the concept of green cities in developed countries is designed for self-reliance and social, economic and environmental sustainability. Then, in paragraph 11, the writer uses "however" to note that the concept of green cities in low-income developing countries has a special application and significantly different social and economic aspects. 4- In paragraph 7, the writer's tone is pessimistic. The writer describes the situation in the cities using words such as "the new population bomb", "a nightmare", "degraded" and "impoverished" and refers to the population as "vulnerable" and "socially excluded". However, in paragraph 8, the tone becomes hopeful and optimistic. The writer refers to the "brighter future" that is "possible" for the developing cities and describes cities as a place for "better" economy or life and "improved" living standards. C- Poor slum dwellers live in deprived areas in the city, and their children suffer from malnutrition although they spend most of their income on food. 5
