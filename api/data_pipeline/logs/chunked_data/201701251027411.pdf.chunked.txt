The Tornado Mystery 1 The myth of tornadoes continues to puzzle storm researchers. Why do they form out of one severe thunderstorm but not another? On one day but not the next? Why is one more powerful than another? And most particularly, perhaps, why is one tornado two hundred feet wide and another a mile or more in diameter? 2 A tornado is a violent rotating column of air extending from a thunderstorm to the ground. The most violent tornadoes are capable of tremendous destruction with wind speeds of up to 480 km per hour. They can destroy large buildings, uproot trees and hurl vehicles hundreds of meters. 3 Forces other than damaging winds are at work inside tornadoes. Sometimes, as the twisting funnel passes over a house, the walls and ceiling burst apart as if a bomb had gone off inside. This is caused by the low air pressure at the center of a tornado. 4 The pressure at the center of a tornado is usually thirteen pounds per square inch. However, inside the house the air pressure is normal, about fifteen pounds per square inch. The difference in pounds per square inch between the inside and outside pressure may not seem much. But suppose a tornado funnel passes over a small building that measures 20 by 10 by 10 feet. On each square inch of this building, there is pressure from the inside that is not balanced by air pressure outside the building. This unbalanced pressure adds up with more inches of the ceiling and the four walls and becomes higher and more dangerous. 5 If windows are open in the building, some of the inside air will rush out through them. This will balance the pressure inside and outside the building. But if the windows are shut tightly, the enormous inside pressure may cause the building to burst. 6 Unfortunately, heavy rain and hail often occur in thunderstorms that later produce tornadoes. So people frequently shut all windows to protect their property. This may cause far worse damage later. For the same reason, the door of an underground storm shelter must have an air opening for relief of pressure. Otherwise, the shelter door might be blown out when a tornado passes over it. 7 Predicting tornadoes is so difficult that many people up till now rely on natural warning signs such as sky color and thunder. But none, alone or together, guarantees a tornado is coming soon. Not even the best weather-forecasting technology can determine more than a few minutes ahead of time whether or not a tornado will strike. 1

Due to Part Two: Writing (Score: 16/40) Choose ONE of the following prompts: Prompt (A): Natural hazards caused by hurricanes, earthquakes, floods etc. can be disastrous because they lead to losses in life and property. People must be made aware of procedures they should follow before, during and after a natural disaster emergency. Provide an outline and then write an essay in which you explain the above statement. As you develop your essay, refer to how different parties (e.g. people, governments, schools or media) can spread awareness about the procedures that should be taken to protect people in case of a natural disaster.
