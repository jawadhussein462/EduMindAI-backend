International Organizations 1 The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) is a that United Nations agency works to promote and protect the human rights that are guaranteed under international law and stipulated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948. The office was established by the United Nations General Assembly in the wake of the 1993 World Conference on Human Rights. 2 Known as the principal United Nations office to promote and protect human rights, OHCHR leads global human rights efforts devotedly and speaks out objectively against human rights violations worldwide. It provides a medium for identifying, highlighting and developing responses to today's human rights challenges and acts as the principal focal point of human rights research, education, public information and advocacy activities in the United Nations system. 3 Because governments have the primary responsibility to protect human rights, the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) provides assistance to them, such as expertise and technical trainings in the areas of administration of justice, lawmaking and election process to help implement international human rights standards on the ground. It also assists other entities in the responsibility of protecting human rights to fulfil their obligations and individuals to realize their rights. 4 Since the establishment of the United Nations in 1945, promoting and encouraging respect for human rights for all without distinction as to race, sex, language, or religion, as specified in the United Nations Charter, has been one of the fundamental goals of the organization. The OHCHR is concerned with mainstreaming human rights within the United Nations, which means injecting a human rights perspective into all United Nations programs. This is to ensure that peace and security, development, and human rights are interlinked and mutually supportive. 5 This task is essential at a time when the United Nations is undergoing its most far-reaching reform. As we face ever changing challenges in the new millennium, the international community puts human rights at center-stage in addressing various pressing issues worldwide. 6 With its leading human rights role and the important task of integrating human rights into the United Nations system, OHCHR works with different entities and parties. It coordinates work with governments, civil society and national human rights institutions. 1

7 The OHCHR method of work focuses on three major dimensions: standard setting, monitoring, and implementation on the ground. Teams at OHCHR work to offer the best expertise, and vital support to the different United Nations human rights bodies. OHCHR, for example, serves as the Secretariat of the Human Rights Council, which is the key intergovernmental body in the United Nations responsible for human rights. 8 Within that framework, the work of special independent experts, and operational groups is supported by OHCHR to monitor human rights in different countries or in relation to specific issues. Independent experts are assisted as they carry out visits to the field, receive and consider direct complaints from victims of human rights violations, and appeal to governments on behalf of victims. Another example of the standard-setting and monitoring dimensions is the legal research and support it provides to the organizations that issue human rights agreements. These independent experts are authorized to make sure that State organizations fulfil their human rights treaty obligations. They meet regularly to examine reports from State organizations and issue their recommendations. 9 Finally, OHCHR supreme effort rests in its work on ensuring the realization and implementation of international human rights standards on the ground by involving more countries and by being physically present to observe these standards. Over the years, OHCHR has increased its presence in the field, reaching out to the people who need it the most. Field presence plays a crucial role in identifying, highlighting, and developing responses to human rights challenges, in close collaboration with governments, non-governmental organizations and members of civil society. Among these responses is monitoring human rights situations on the ground in addition to executing projects designed in cooperation with member States. These projects include technical trainings and support in the areas of administration of justice and human rights education.
