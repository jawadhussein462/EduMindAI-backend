Exercise 1 (7 points) Kinetic Study of the Reaction of Ethyl Ethanoate with Sodium Hydroxide A volume V = 8.0 mL of a sodium hydroxide solution (Na+(aq)+HO"(aq)) of concentration C= 0.20 mol.L-1 is poured into a 500 mL beaker containing distilled water. The volume of the resulting solution is 400mL. The combined electrode of a calibrated pH-meter is dipped in the solution and continuous stirring is maintained.
