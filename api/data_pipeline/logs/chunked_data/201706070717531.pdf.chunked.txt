Land and Water 1 There is significant geographic variation in the availability of land considered suitable for agriculture. The problem of population growth places much pressure on available resources of water and land. Currently cultivated land -or land prepared for growing plants and crops- is mostly of good quality due to the use of well-adapted production systems. The highest regional proportion of prime or good quality land currently cultivated is found in Central America and the Caribbean, forty-two percent, followed by Western and Central Europe, thirty-eight percent, and Northern America, thirty- seven percent. 2 For high income countries as a whole, the share of good quality prime land in currently cultivated land is just thirty percent. In low income countries, soils are often poor and only twenty- eight percent of total cultivated land is classified as prime land. 3 The world's cultivated area has grown by twelve percent over the last fifty years. The global area irrigated with water pipes has doubled over the same period, accounting for most of the increase in cultivated land. Also, agricultural production has grown between two and three times, thanks to significant increase in the production of major crops. 4 However, global achievements in production in some regions have been associated with decrease in land and water resources and the deterioration of ecosystem goods and services. These include carbon storage, soil health, water storage and supply, biodiversity and social and cultural services. Agriculture already uses eleven percent of the world's land surface for crop production. It also makes use of seventy percent of all water withdrawn from streams and lakes. Agricultural policies have primarily benefitted farmers with productive land and access to water, bypassing the majority of small-scale producers who are still locked in a poverty trap of high vulnerability, ruined land and climatic uncertainty. 5 The plans of land and water institutions have not kept pace with the increasing degree of inter- dependence and competition over land and water resources. Much more adaptable and collaborative institutions and policies are needed to respond effectively to natural resources scarcity and market opportunities. 6 Toward 2050, rising population and incomes are expected to call for seventy percent more food production globally, and up to one-hundred percent more in developing countries, relative to 2009 levels. Yet, the distribution of land and water resources does not favor those countries that need to 1

produce more in the future: the availability of cultivated land in low-income countries is less than half that of high-income countries, and the suitability of cultivated land for cropping is generally lower. Some countries with rapidly growing demand for food are also those that face high levels of land or water scarcity. 7 The prevailing manner of agricultural production needs to be critically reviewed. A series of land and water systems now face the menace of the breakdown of their productive capacity under a combination of excessive demographic pressure and unsustainable agricultural practices. The limited availability of land and water within these systems may be further exacerbated in places by external threats, including climate change, competition with other sectors and socio-economic changes. They require priority attention for corrective actions simply because there are no substitutes. 8 The potential conditions exist to expand production efficiently in order to address food security and poverty while limiting negative impacts on other ecosystem values. There is a chance for governments and the private sector, including farmers, to take more actions for improving management practices to ensure sustainable land and water resources. Actions include technical options to promote sustainable resources and reduce production risks. Land and water management practices will require a global political determination to financially support and encourage wise agricultural policies. Only by these changes can the world feed its citizens through a sustainable agriculture that produces within environmental limits.

Part Two: Writing: Choose ONE of the following prompts: (Score: 16/40) Prompt (A): Read the following statement from a research paper on the problem of water scarcity. In recent years, the UN and other international organizations have pointed out the shortage of water for human usage as a major problem for this century. The crisis is a widespread phenomenon specially in the under-developed countries, where life can be seriously threatened due to the lack of this precious resource. Write an essay in which you explain the above statement. As you develop your essay, refer to the impact of shortage of water on the environment, industry and human health. In your essay, provide a thesis statement in the introduction, a topic sentence in each body paragraph and support the main idea with relevant, specific and adequate details. Give examples drawn from your reading, experience or observation. Your essay should be between 250-300 words with an appropriate title. Revise and proofread your essay. Prompt (B): Read the following statement from an article about the use of water and land. Experience shows that improving practices in using land and water can enhance food security and reduce poverty. These practices can restore the productivity of degraded agricultural land. But achieving gains from such practices will only happen if farmers and private sectors work with local communities even without any governmental support. Write an argumentative essay in which you argue for or against the above statement. As you develop your essay, support your position by drawing on logical reasoning and experience.
