It is inscribed on two pages. The use of a non programmable calculator is allowed. Answer the questions on the following three exercises. Exercise 1 (7points) Halogenated Derivatives of Methane The Montreal Protocol is an international agreement adopted on 22 March 1985. Its objective is to reduce and eliminate substances that deplete the ozone layer. This Protocol requires the elimination of the utilization of CFCs and other substances that deplete the ozone layer and cause a global warming such as tetrachloromethane , bromochloromethane and hydrobromofluorocarbons. HFCs are less stable than CFCs, and therefore less destructive, but still retain a significant impact on the ozone layer and are potent greenhouse gases. In recognition of the efforts made by the Lebanese Government, Lebanon was awarded by the Montreal Protocol the << Prize for the best implementation of the National Ozone Unit>>. 1000 900 700 CFC (t) 500 400 300 200 100 O Year 1992 1994 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004 2006 2008 2010 1 - By referring to document 1 and to the text answer the following questions: The consumption of CFCs in Lebanon in tons (1992-2010) Source: MOE National Ozone Unit. 2011 1.1. Give the consumption of CFCs in tons in Lebanon in 2002 and in 2009. 1.2. Compare the two values found. 1.3. Why has Lebanon been awarded by the Montreal Protocol? 1.4.
