Most economic indicators showed a slowdown or a decline in the improvement rates. The economic growth in Lebanon is expected to fall below 2% in 2012, compared with a projected 3.5% growth for this period. This decline in growth estimates is due to the challenges that Lebanese economy faced in 2011 until mid-2012. These challenges, some of which are internal and mainly linked to the political conflict and the state of stagnation (statuquo) that prevented the start of the process of financial and administrative reform, and some of which are regional such as the impact of security and political turmoil in many Arab countries on the economic situation and on the flow of investment and others are international as the impact of the financial crisis in a number of European countries, in addition to the rise in world oil prices. Document no.2: ( ... ) The public policies that raise risks in the public budget are more influential than external shocks and the repercussions of the Syrian crisis. The recent adjustment in the scale of wages and salaries for public sector employees would cost the Treasury between $ 1 billion and $ 1.5 billion yearly, which is equivalent to half of the budget deficit in 2011. Also, the 2013 budget includes a 25% increase in expenditures and includes new taxes to cover the increase in spending in order to keep the deficit at $ 3.5 billion. For that, the budget deficit is expected to exceed 7.5% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2012 compared to 6.2% of GDP in 2011. However, Lebanon needs more than ever public investment, from infrastructure such as electricity, telecommunications and transport, to social spending, in its forefront comes the total medical coverage for all Lebanese. Public investments have an important impact on improving macroeconomic indicators and raising the welfare of society, not to mention their contribution to economic growth. ( ... ) The most difficult thing to justify, however, is ignoring the economic decision as the legislative work for their importance in raising the competitiveness of the investment climate and 2
