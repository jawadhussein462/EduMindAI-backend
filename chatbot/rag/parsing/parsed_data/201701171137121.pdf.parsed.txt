(7 points) 3- Do you believe that the simplification of rules of grammar and spelling serve the language? Justify your answer? (4 points) Subject Three: Text It is as easy for the imagination to form monsters and to join incongruous shapes and appearances as it is to conceive the most natural and familiar objects. But although our thought seems to be so free, when we look more carefully we'll find that it is really confined within very narrow limits, and that all this creative power of the mind amounts merely to the ability to combine, transpose, enlarge, or shrink the materials that the senses and experience provide us with. When we think of a golden mountain, we only join two consistent ideas-gold and mountain-with which we were already familiar. We can conceive a virtuous horse because our own feelings enable us to conceive virtue, and we can join this with the shape of a horse, which is ananimal we know. In short, all the materials of thinking are derived either from our outward senses or from our inward feelings. Here are two arguments that I hope will suffice to prove this: 1) When we analysis our thoughts or ideas-however complex or elevated they are-we always find them to be made up of simple ideas that were copied from earlier feelings or sensations. 2) If a man can't have some kind of sensation because there is something wrong with his eyes, ears etc., he will never be found to have corresponding ideas. A blind mancan't form a notion of colors. David Hume 1- Explain this text of Hume and state the problematic it raises. (9 points) 2- Discuss the ideas of the text in light of other theories that deal with imagination. (7 points) 3- Do you think, that imagination is able to liberate man form the enslavement of reality? Justify. (4 points) 1

Problematic (2 points) General (0.5 pt.): What is the relationship between philosophy and science? Specific (1.5 pt.): Is science totally different from philosophy and contradicts it? Would there not be some complementarity between the two? Thesis (5 points) Preliminary idea (0.5 pt.): Indeed, Science and philosophy are two kinds of knowledge that are distinguished by their subject, their method and their results, for which the relationship between these two disciplines was not always a relationship of understanding and Complementarity. At present, several scholars consider that philosophy is no longer a necessity for the evolution of human life. Explanation of the judgment (4 pts): - We should emphasize the divergence of the two disciplines: · Science provides laws: philosophy elaborates only thesis. · Scientific knowledge is general and universal, philosophy cannot claim it. · An ignorant can philosophize, to fill the gaps in knowledge. No one denies it. · Science advances and surpasses itself. Philosophy tramples. · Science is embodied in techniques, philosophy is limited to speculation. - That is why philosophy pretends to be a "poor relation" in the fields of knowledge. - It would be good to put forward an example to support each idea. Creativity and coherence (0.5 pt.) Second question: Discussion (7 points) Transition (0.5 pt.): Despite the growing importance of science and their ability to explain several phenomena of nature, philosophy is always a necessity. Internal review (1 pt.): · The sciences have not been able to answer all the questions of humanity. 2

· There is a growing recourse to philosophical theories. Many scholars have turned to philosophy at last. External review (3.5 pts): Science does not threaten philosophy; it provides new tools. The scientist needs to philosophize, like every human being, to give meaning to his existence - The more philosophers - scholars there are, the more the human personality is enriched The scientist has much to learn from philosophy, the cult of the critical spirit. - Scientific curiosity is an innate attitude (we need to understand the phenomena of nature ... ). This is also the case of the philosophical attitude. - It would be good to put forward an example to support each idea. Synthesis (1.5 pt.): Let us conclude that between the sciences and philosophy today there is no motive of dissent; they both serve one and the same cause, and contribute to a common result: the happiness of man. The controversies of our time will pass away like so many others, without leaving any more traces; and above all they will not alter the essential relations of philosophy and science. But what one might expect from the scholars who delight in these polemics would be to show a little more tolerance. Creativity and coherence (0.5 pt.) Third question: (4 points) Explanation of the question (1 pt) Justification (2.5 pts): - The candidate could answer this question affirmatively or negatively or dialectically, provided that he justifies his answer. - The candidate can reply by: • Yes. It is urgent that philosophy comes to the rescue of our universe threatened with violence, racism, intolerance. Only philosophy can fulfill this mission because it is rational and is a culture of values. (The humanistic philosophies ... ). • No. Violence itself can forge an ideology to justify itself (Nazism). Creativity and coherence (0.5 pt.) Subject Two: First question: (9 points) Introduction (2 points) - We can launch the debate by defining the concepts "language", "thought" ... - ... or underlining the exclusively human nature of these activities. Problematic (2 points) General (0.5 pt.): What are the language - thought relationships? Specific (1.5 pt.): Can we affirm the priority of language? Or would it be the product of thought? Or (Begin by thinking? Or would the language precede the thought?) Thesis (5 points) Preliminary idea (0.5 pt.): In fact, one would be tempted to admit, at first sight, that language is the expression of a thought already ready: we think, we judge, and then we formulate our thought in using sentences and words. Or, there is nothing. 3

Explanation of the judgment (4 pts): Some philosophers hold that language precedes thought. They are not short of arguments: · Expression, when it is precise and rich, is essential to the reasoning (in the scientific, or legal aspect .. ). · By educating the expression, one guarantees a better thought, and even more noble feelings (the titles "Your Honor", "Master", a formal way of addressing others .... ). · Psychoanalysis itself proves that the expression precedes and permits awareness. · The study of etymological origin enriches thought. · By prohibiting abuses, or racist expressions, one purifies thought and ennobles feelings. · When a new concept is forged, the judgment takes advantage of it. - We know that deaf - mutes cannot hoist their thoughts in - depth till they master their study of sign language. (How to think "psychologically", "psychiatry", "psychologically" ... And grasp the complexity of the field if one does not have the concepts?). - Language precedes thought and creates it. Creativity and coherence (0.5 pt.) Second question: Discussion (7 points) Transition (0.5 pt.): Despite the different points of view which consider that language conveys thought and supports it, psychological studies show that thought exists before language. Internal review (1 pt.): · Language betrays thought by failing in its duty of a faithful transcription of ideas. Words are lacking to express a thought yet clear to my mind. · language is only a mask of thought, for Descartes the cause of errors is that "men give their attention to words rather than to things and their consent to terms they do not understand at all ". · If a language conditioned thought, translation would not only be difficult, it would be impossible. External review (3.5 pts): - A broad philosophical current judges that language is the concretization of a thought that precedes and determines it. Their arguments are numerous: - The same idea can be expressed in different languages, and in different ways (ironic, symbolic ... ). - Language "dresses" thought. - If there is no idea, the expression will be broken. - We sometimes have an idea, and try to find the expression that suits it. It had pre-existed, then. "We can silence an idea, and keep it for ourselves." It will remain "naked". One can also lie, and "betray the idea". It is because thought precedes expression. Synthesis (1.5 pt.): · It is good to synthesize. Relations are dialectical: thought produces the language that is being shaped by it. · if language can betray thought, it is not in the sense that it does not fulfill a servile function of transcribing a pure, clear and distinct thought but that it is the whole risk of the betrayal of That is, completely reveal the secret work of thought that takes flesh in the human experience of saying. Creativity and coherence (0.5 pt.) Third question: (4 points) Explanation of the question (1 pt.) Justification (2.5 pts): - The candidate could answer this question affirmatively or negatively or dialectically, provided that he justifies his answer. - The candidate can reply by: 4

- Yes, language must remain easy simple and devoid of complications. - No, because that rids language of its beauty and leads to its impoverishment. Subject three: Text First question: (9 points) Introduction (2 points) - Life is becoming more and more complex as we live it. Therefore the need for imagination is becoming more and more demanding as we move forward at the time where man is facing more obstacles and difficulties where imagination is helping transcending reality. - Many philosophers focused in their doubts on imagination, its function and the way it works, its efficacy and themes: they differed on these topics. - This text belongs to the empiricists' way of thinking. Problematic (2 points) General (0.5 pt.): What is the nature of the imagination? Specific (1.5 pts): What limits our imagination? Is it rooted in the tangible experiences or it is able to surpass them? Thesis(5 points) Preliminary idea (0.5 pt.) - The candidate has to explain the ideas of the text. - It is important to state the school of thought that the text belongs to. - The main concept of this school of thought. Explanation of the text (4 pts): - The first part of the text focuses on the role of imagination and its capability and the simple way it works by. The ability to imagine images and weird shapes does not exist in reality. There is no difference between this ability and the ability to imagine things that are known to us. - The second part focuses on the close relation between the work of imagination and the sensible experience that man goes through: the creative cognitive power is nothing but assembling, copying and pasting or editing to what we have perceived with our senses. - Give clarifying examples. - Clarifying the meaning of sensing internally and sensing externally. - The proofs that the narrator used to confirm his point of view. - Back up the ideas of the text by other thoughts of different philosophers: Locke and John Stuart Mill. Second question: Discussion (7 points) Transition (0.5 pt.): The idea of the mental image through which the empiricists explained the whole psychic life, was modified by contemporary philosophy, following Alain and the phenomenological works, Existence of mental images. Internal review (1 pt.): Oppose the empiricists' point of view. 5

Present other point of views rejected the empiricists' point of view: Alain, Bechelar, the phenomenologists and last Sartre. It is important for the candidate to elaborate on the point of view that he/she had chosen and all its aspects. External review (3.5 pts): There is no residue or decaying sensation in the mind of man. The state of being conscious of an object that is not present in the external world. - Imagination frees man from reality and the limits/chains of time and space. - Imagination goes beyond the assembling of images that previously perceive to discover new relationship with the elements of the world. - It is an inclination towards the future. - The subjectivity of the imagination is part of who I am. Synthesis (1.5 pt.): - As a synthesis, no matter what is the nature of imagination empirical or rational, it expresses the longing of man to the new and strange aspects ... It allows man to free himself from the chains of reality. Creativity and coherence (0.5pt.) Third question: Personal opinion (4 points) Explanation of the question (1 pt.) Justification (2.5 pts): - The candidate could answer this question affirmatively or negatively or dialectically, provided that he justifies his answer. The candidate can reply by: - Yes. Imagination "produced" literature, arts and theater, and it is capable of freeing us from reality. (A prisoner that is separated from his prison cell; imagines, writes or draws). - No. normal man imagines and does not mix between what is real and what is imagined. On the other hand reality became more miserable and saddening because of the beauty of what we image. Creativity and coherence (0.5pt.) 6
