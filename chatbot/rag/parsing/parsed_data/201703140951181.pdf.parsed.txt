The use of non-programmable calculators is allowed. Exercise 1 (5 points) Determination of the focal length of a converging lens In a lab session, we have a converging lens (L), a luminous object AB of height 2 cm and a screen. The aim is to determine the focal length of (L). We place the object at a distance d from the lens (L). We note that when the distance D between the object and the screen is 90 cm, we obtain on the screen a sharp image of height 4 cm. The figure (Doc 1) below shows the object AB, its real image A'B' and the optical axis x'x of (L). Screen B < X A' X > A 1 |cm 5 cm (Doc 1) VB' 1) Redraw, on a graph paper, the above figure (Doc 1). 2) The straight line passing through B and B' meets the optical axis x'x at a point O. 2-1) Explain why the point O is the optical center of (L). 2-2) Represent the lens (L) on the figure. 3) To determine the focal length of the lens (L), we draw a luminous ray issued from B parallel to the optical axis. 3-1) Complete the path of this ray. 3-2) Indicate on the figure, with justification, the position of the image focus F' of (L). 3-3) Deduce the focal length of (L). Exercise 2 (4 points) Pressure of a confined gas The aim of this exercise is to determine the pressure of a confined gas. For this purpose, we performed the experiment represented by the adjacent document (Doc 2) and obtained: H = 75 cm and h = 50 cm. Vacuum Confined gas Both tubes and the tank contain mercury of density p = 13600 kg/m3.Take: g = 10 N/kg. 1) The pressures at points A and B are equal.

Exercise 3 (61/2 points) Alternating voltage and the adjustment of an oscilloscope The adjacent document (Doc 3) represents the waveform of an alternating voltage u delivered, across its terminals, by a low frequency generator (LFG). The maximum value of the voltage u is Um = 15 V and its period is T = 20 ms. 1) Adjustment of the oscilloscope. 1-1) Determine the vertical sensitivity Sv of the oscilloscope. 1-2) Determine the horizontal sensitivity Sh of the oscilloscope. Voltage u. 2) 2-1) Indicate the type of the alternating voltage u. 2-2) Calculate the frequency of u. 2-3) Calculate the effective value of u. (Doc 3) 2-4) A lamp (L), of rated voltage 15 V, is directly connected across the terminals of the (LFG). Specify if the lamp (L) glows strongly, normally or dimly. Exercise 4 (41/2 points) Determination of the density of a liquid The aim of this exercise is to measure the density p of a liquid (L). For this purpose, we have a solid (S) whose weight is of magnitude W = 5 N, a spring balance and a graduated cylinder containing liquid (L) of volume V1 = 250 ml as shown in the adjacent document (Doc 4). We suspend (S) from the spring balance and immerse it completely in liquid (L). At equilibrium, the level of the liquid corresponds to the graduation V2 = 300 ml and the spring balance indicates 4.6 N as shown in the adjacent document (Doc 5).

The points B, B' and the optical center of the lens are thus aligned. In addition, the optical center belongs to the optical axis. Then the optical center is the intersection between the ray BB' and the optical axis. In our case, it is the point O. 1 1/2 2-2 1/2 (L) Screen B X A' A O 1 cm > 5 cm B' 1/3
