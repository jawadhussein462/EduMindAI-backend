(9 points) (7 points) 2- Discuss this judgment in the light of other theories. 3- Do you see that the different statistical results of a social phenomenon can lead us to question the objectivity of sociology? Justify your answer. (4 points) Subject Two: Philosophy opens new horizons to science. 1- Explain this judgment and identify the problem it raises. (9 points) (7 points) 2- Discuss this judgment by relying on other concepts. 3- Do you believe that philosophy can help promote a culture of dialogue? Justify your answer? (4 points) Subject Three: Text Thusthe question, how a categorical imperative is possible, can indeed be answered to the extent that one can furnish the sole presupposition on which alone it is possible, namely the idea of freedom, and that one can also see the necessity of this presupposition, which is sufficient for the practical use of reason, that is for the conviction of the validity of this imperative as so also of the moral law; but how this presupposition itself is possible can never be seen by any human reason. That being said, once assumed that the will is free, its autonomy, as a formal condition under which alone it can be determined, is a necessary consequence. To assume the freedom of the will is not only entirely possible, but it is necessary for any being, from a practical point of view, to assume that the will is free, and that is the condition for all the actions that proceed from his freedom. Kant 1- Explain this text and identify the problem it raises. (9 points) 2- Discuss this concept by relying on other moral systems. (7 points) 3- Do you believe that computer and technical progress is reflected in moral laws and their application? Justify your answer. (4 points) 1

Problematic (2 points) General (0.5 pt.): What is the appropriate approach for Social Sciences? Specific (1.5 pts.): Is it true that social phenomenon can be explained as we explain the phenomena of nature? Or is it exclusively one of the humanities? Thesis (5 points) Preliminary idea (0.5 pt.): Sociology follows a specific methodology which is like trying to mimic the methodology of positivism in science. - Talking about sociology as a science and social phenomena that relies mainly on direct observation. Explanation of the judgement (4 pts.): - Focus on Durkheim's position, which is that sociology studies something, and that the results given is objective results. - The importance of comparisons and its adoption in the study of social phenomenon. - Give for such basic statistics as a way to reach conclusions about social phenomena in sociology. - Signal to other approved methods in sociology as a cast out opinion. An investigation, and a demographic study of the situation. - Signal to other sociologists that agreed on Durkheim's position such as August Comte. Creativity and coherence (0.5 pt.) Second question: Discussion (7 points) - Transition (0.5 pt): A criticism of Durkheim's position when he tried to even out between science of positivism and social sciences. - Do a small comparison showing the differences between the experimental sciences and social sciences. - Focus on the subjective impact in the findings in social sciences and specifically in sociology. Internal review (1 pt.): 2

It goes without saying that man cannot be reduced to a matter, or studied as a matter, because he is a conscious and free being. We cannot talk about causality when it comes to man, nor to elaborate universal and generalizable laws, nor to foresee ... External Review (3.5 pts.): - To emphasize that the results of social sciences remain approximate. - Display the views of some of the offenders of the sociologists' opinion of Durkheim such as Jules Monro and Max Weber. - To cite some examples of realism on the opinions and theories described. Synthesis (1.5 pt.): Beyond the preference given to this or that technique of research or analysis, sociology is a certain look at life in society or, if one prefers, a certain way of conceptualizing social life. It is not a question of neglecting objectivity in the practice of sociology, but of overcoming it in order to reveal the reasoning it conceals. The sociological view substitutes the usual image of a multitude of individuals animated by their passions and their personal preferences, the vision of interactions structured by the elements that form social life. Creativity and coherence (0.5 pts) Third question: Personal opinion (4 points) Explanation of the question (1 pt.) Justification (2.5 pts): - The candidate could answer this question affirmatively or negatively or dialectically, provided that he/she justifies his/her answer. - Yes, because sociologists depend on the numbers as a secured answer and it is objective, given that if it is contradicted, it is an indication of weak results. - No, because all natural and non-natural sciences cannot reach a final answer, and this differences stimulate further research. Creativity and coherence (0.5 pts) Subject Two: First question: (9 points) Introduction (2 points) - At the origin, philosophy was a universal knowledge that included all sciences. It originated in Greece and presented itself as an encyclopedic learning, around the sixth century BC. - Science is the knowledge we get from study, experiments, and observation. - A brief history of the relationship between science and philosophy ... Problematic (2 points) General (0.5 pt.): What is the relationship between these two disciplines? Specific (1.5 pts.): Do they complete each other or compete with one another?Is one developing at the expense of the other? 3

Thesis(5 points) Preliminary idea (0.5 pt.): It is fair to remember that philosophy was "encyclopedic knowledge". Many scholars were philosophers (Descartes, Poincaré , Pythagoras ... ) Philosophy teaches the scientist to get away from his knowledge, which is in the interest of science. The history of science is a series of "revolutions" and "corrections" no scientific certainty is final. Explanation of the judgement (4 pts.): - It is said that the relationship between science and philosophy is dialectical. - Both philosophy and science seek knowledge. - The philosopher can reflect on any subject, such as science, its methods, its processes, its results, its applications and the moral problems that follow. - Despite the triumph of science and technical power, philosophical demand reappears as a reflection on the foundation of this knowledge, which was acquired by learning, and on the conditions of this power. - Philosophy "monitors" the scientific labor (bioethics, for example) it ensures to guarantee objectivity (philosophy of history ... ) it therefore renders a service to the sciences Creativity and coherence (0.5 pt.) Second question: Discussion (7 points) Transition (0.5 pt.): However, this rivalry between science and philosophy must not hide the complementarity and mutual services that go hand in hand. Internal review (1 pt.): - The problems of society and political problems are becoming increasingly complex, hence the need for a good general education based on philosophy. Every human being has a proper philosophy that governs his whole life. Through this philosophy, he discusses the most heated questions that concern the meaning of life. This preoccupation is the characteristic of philosophy. - Today's philosophy is to raise awareness of the issue of human dignity, which means that every human being is above all and at all costs. External review (3.5 pts): Science is an effort to explain the real. It is the positive study of the facts that are supplied by experiment and of the laws that manage it. - A comparison between science and philosophy. - Science is ongoing. Science is continually refining and expanding our knowledge of the universe, and as it does, it leads to new questions for future investigation. - Plato demanded that we are engineers to learn philosophy. - Many philosophers were scholars (Descartes, Poincaré ... ) — At the level of the object: a science is limited to an object, with all ambition, the discovery of LAWS, and philosophy develops PRINCIPLES. - A scientific law is general and universal.Philosophical conceptions are multiple, ... - Science experiments and proves, philosophy speculates and argues. — Science is "fertilized" in techniques. Philosophy remains theoretical and sterile .. Synthesis (1.5 pts): "Philosophy nourishes and is nourished by sciences. Philosophy and science are situated on two different levels, they are complementary and they render mutual services. Creativity and coherence (0.5 pt.) 4

Third question: Personal opinion(4 points) Explanation of the question (1 pt.) Justification (2.5 pts): - The candidate could answer this question affirmatively or negatively or dialectically, provided that he/she justifies his/her answer. - Yes: philosophy is a search for the truth and not its possession (tolerance, a call to dialogue). - No: theories in philosophy (racism, bigotry ... ) find "philosophies" at their service. Creativity and coherence (0.5 pt.) Subject three: Text First question: (9 points) Introduction (2 points) - Introduce with the concept "ethics" or "morality". - Emphasis on the human character of morality. Problematic (2 points) General (0.5 pt.): What is the criterion that would allow us to judge our actions and those of others? Specific (1.5 pts.): How do we recognize the goodand Evil? Thesis (5 points) Preliminary idea (0.5 pt.): It should be explained, starting from the text, Kant's concept with particular emphasis on "The categorical imperative" a dear term to Kant. Explanation of the judgment (4 pts.): Kant believes that it is essential for morality to presuppose that man has an immortal soul, and that God exists, and that man has a free will.It is not reason that brings Kant to these beliefs but faith. He calls faith in the immortal soul, in God's existence, and in man's free will practical postulates.To postulate something is to assume something that cannot be proved. By a practical postulate, Kant means something that has to be assumed for the sake of practice (as opposed to theory) for man's morality. - Kant's ethics is sometimes called duty ethics: only when you do something purely out of duty can it be called a moral action. - Kant's ethics is also called a good will ethic: when you act out of good will, the action is morally right. - We all have access to the same universal moral law.This moral law has the same absolute validity as the physical laws. Since this moral law precedes experience, it is formal: it is not bound to any particular situation of moral choice. It applies to all people in all societies at all times. It does not say that you shall do this or that in such or such a situation. It says how you are to behave in all situations. - Kant formulates the moral law as a categorical imperative.The moral law is categorical since it applies to all situations (it does not depend on certain specific conditions; it is unconditional). It is imperative(it gives a command to follow): it is commanding and therefore absolutely authoritative. Kant formulates the categorical imperative by saying, "Act as if the maxim (rule of conduct) of your action were to become through your will a Universal Law of Nature" (when you do something, make sure that you want everybody else to do the same if they are in the same situation). 5

- Kant also formulates the categorical imperative in this way, "Act in such a way that you always treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, never simply as a means, but always at the same time as an end". Creativity and coherence (0.5 pt.) Second question: Discussion (7 points) Transition (0.5 pt.): However, the moral of Kant appears as a logic of the action. Moral action must respect the very form of reason. This is the Kantian formalism. Internal review (1 pt.): Criticism of Kant: Many considered that Kant's exaggerated in his idealism, because this idealism is not accessible to humans. - Peguy: "Kant has clean hands, but he has no hands! (This moral is excellent but impossible to implement!). External review (3.5 pts): - The Well, this is pleasure (A.de Cyrene) - Hedonism: Aristippus (Pleasure is the ultimate good + sensation is the basis of morality), Hegesias (Pleasure is rarely realizable + avoiding pains by killing desires), Epicurus (There is no goodness without sensation + excess leads to pain). - Utilitarianism: Utility is the ultimate good + compare and calculate pains and pleasures. Synthesis (1.5 pts):By way of conclusion, therefore, the wrong of moral doctrines has been either to shut oneself up in one of the two aspects of morality, or to try to surpass them, but by ruining both. These two notions are complementary both from a theoretical and a practical point of view. On the theoretical as well as the practical plane, the notion of duty expresses the transcendent aspect of value, which must be complemented by the morals of the Good, which consider that the order of values must be based on reason and based on Serenity and balance. Creativity and coherence (0.5 pt.) Third question: Personal opinion(4 points) Explanation of the question (1 pt.) Justification (2.5 pts): - The candidate could answer this question affirmatively or negatively or dialectically, provided that he/she justifies his/her answer. - Yes: technologies dictate new laws and ethics (especially immigration and money transfer new rules ... Morality cannot ignore the changes around us: the internet, immigrant waves, and complications due to remittances ... require moral laws. -No: moral principles remain the same - the values are invariable. Creativity and coherence (0.5 pt.) 6
