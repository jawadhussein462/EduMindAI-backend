Choose one of the following sets- Part 2: Optional Set- First choice set- Analyzing Social Documents (12 pts.) Document 1: The Social Security Institution is one of the most important achievements of the era of President Fouad Chehab. This achievement came as a culmination to encounter the struggle of the Lebanese trade union movement on the one hand and the conviction of the Chehabi covenant on the necessity of establishing a social welfare state, on the other hand. This confirms the importance of security, benefiting one third of the Lebanese population from the services of this institution (more than one million two hundred thousand people). At the current stage, the sector is facing serious problems and difficulties that may threaten its future and the objectives for which it was created. For example, the burden of disease falls on the citizen and the private sector, while state intervention is insufficient. State coverage of public hospitals has dropped from 26% to 10% and for private hospital beds to more than 50%. The security system fund in Lebanon does not provide equal rights for women and men, since women cannot cover their husbands unless they suffer from disability, and coverage in the institution only affects sickness and maternity, family compensation and end of service indemnities, no health coverage after beneficiary reaching retirement age. المصدر: ندوة بعنوان" حوار حول الضمان الاجتماعي " د. عصام خليفة ود. كريستيان صليبا، 7/ 2/ 2017 (بتصرف)

Document 2: المصدر : الموازنة العامة للدولة اللبنانية من سنة 1994 الى سنة 2005. تطور النفقات الإجتماعية (مليار ل.ل) Document 3: مجموع الإنفاق الإجتماعي (بما فيها التقاعد) ■ 3000 2500 2000 1500 1000 500 0 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 The Lebanese governments have neglected spending on social affairs, as expenditure on education, health, social affairs, housing, culture, sports and media did not exceed 15% of public spending, so that it fell in the plan budget in 2017 to 11.5%. Government expenditure from 1993 to 2016 was also highly flawed and marginalized spending on productive sectors: Agricultural and industrial sectors, while focusing on three main items of public debt service, Lebanese Electricity Corporation, wages and salaries. This focus has exacerbated the differences between the strata of society and its regions, and the growing imbalance in the socio-economic balance, and the continuation of this imbalance will inevitably lead to the big explosion. المصدر : جريدة الأخبار، الانفاق العام واختلال التوازن الاجتماعي والاقتصادي، أمين صالح، العدد 3281، 23 أيلول 1.2017 Document 4: A formal study conducted by the Ministry of Social Affairs officially confirmed that 28% of Lebanese suffer from poverty and 8% from extreme poverty. Following this study, a programme was developed to support the poorest families. The problem is to correct the government's inactive performance by formulating a social policy that is integrated with an economic policy. This policy also addresses the reform of the educational system in line with the requirements of the labor market, and contributes to providing opportunities for qualified members. Thus, Lebanon will become a productive country and eliminates unemployment that exceeds 26% and it doubles annually up to 30 thousand unemployed going mainly to migrate to encounter social progress. Poverty is becoming one of the most serious threats to civil peace, and today's responsibility calls for the re-organization of the labor market, and the implementation of existing laws, the modernization of social security legislation, and reaching to the real social security. المصدر: مجلة الضمان الاجتماعي - علي محي الدين-حماية الاستقرار بتامين العيش الكريم العدد 15 ايار 2013 ص67 By referring to the above given documents, answer the following questions: 1.
